APOSTOLIC LETTER LAETAMUR 

MAGNOPERE 

IN WHICH THE LATIN TYPICAL EDITION OF 
THE CATECHISM OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
IS APPROVED AND PROMULGATED 

JOHN PAUL, BISHOP SERVANT OF THE 
SERVANTS OF GOD FOR EVERLASTING 

MEMORY 

To my Venerable Brother Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, Deacons and to 
other members of the People of God. 

It is a Cause for Great Joy that the Latin Typical Edition of the CATECHISM OF THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH is Being Published. It is approved and promulgated by me in this Apostolic Letter and 
thus becomes the definitive text of the aforementioned Catechism. This is occurring about five 
years after the Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum of October 11, 1992, which, on the 30th 
anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council, accompanied the publication of the first, 
French-language text of the Catechism. 

We have all been able to note with pleasure the broad positive reception and wide 
dissemination of the Catechism in these years, especially in the particular Churches, which have 
had it translated into their respective languages, thus making it as accessible as possible to the 
various linguistic communities of the world. This fact confirms how fitting was the request 
submitted to me in 1985 by the Extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops that a catechism 
or compendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding faith and morals be composed. 

Drawn up by the special Commission of Cardinals and Bishops established in 1986, the 
Catechism was approved and promulgated by me in the aforementioned Apostolic Constitution, 
which today retains all its validity and timeliness, and finds its definitive achievement in this Latin 
typical edition. 

This edition was prepared by an Interdicasterial Commission which I appointed for this 
purpose in 1993. Presided over by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, this Commission worked diligently 



to fulfill the mandate it received. It devoted particular attention to a study of the many suggested 
changes to the contents of the text, which in these years had come from around the world and from 
various parts of the ecclesial community. 

In this regard one can certainly understand that such a remarkable number of suggested 
improvements shows the extraordinary interest that the Catechism has raised throughout the world, 
even among non-Christians, and confirms its purpose of being presented as a full, complete 
exposition of Catholic doctrine, enabling everyone to know what the Church professes, celebrates, 
lives, and prays in her daily life. At the same time it draws attention to the eager desire of all to 
make their contribution so that the Christian faith, whose essential and necessary elements are 
summarized in the Catechism, can be presented to the people of our day in the most suitable way 
possible. Furthermore, this collaboration of the various members of the Church will once again 
achieve what I wrote in the Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum: “The harmony of so many 
voices truly expresses what could be called the 'symphony’ of the faith” (no. 2). 

For these reasons too, the Commission seriously considered the suggestions offered, carefully 
examined them at various levels and submitted its conclusions for my approval. These conclusions, 
insofar as they allow for a better expression of the Catechism’s contents regarding the deposit of 
the Catholic faith, or enable certain truths of this faith to be formulated in a way more suited to the 
requirements of contemporary catechetical instruction, have been approved by me and thus have 
been incorporated into this Latin typical edition. Therefore it faithfully repeats the doctrinal content 
which I officially presented to the Church and to the world in December 1992. 

With today’s promulgation of the Latin typical edition, therefore, the task of composing the 
Catechism, begun in 1986, is brought to a close and the desire of the aforementioned Extraordinary 
Synod of Bishops is happily fulfilled. The Church now has at her disposal this new, authoritative 
exposition of the one and perennial apostolic faith, and it will serve as a “valid and legitimate 
instrument for ecclesial communion” and as a “sure norm for teaching the faith,” as well as a “sure 
and authentic reference text” for preparing local catechisms (cf. Apostolic Constitution Fidei 
Depositum, no. 4). 

Catechesis will find in this genuine, systematic presentation of the faith and of Catholic 
doctrine a totally reliable way to present, with renewed fervor, each and every part of the Christian 
message to the people of our time. This text will provide every catechist with sound help for 
communicating the one, perennial deposit of faith within the local Church, while seeking, with the 
help of the Holy Spirit, to link the wondrous unity of the Christian mystery with the varied needs 
and conditions of those to whom this message is addressed. All catechetical activity will be able to 
experience a new, widespread impetus among the People of God, if it can properly use and 
appreciate this post-conciliar Catechism. 



All this seems even more important today with the approach of the third millennium. For an 
extraordinary commitment to evangelization is urgently needed so that everyone can know and 
receive the Gospel message and thus grow “to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ” 
(j Eph 4:13). 

I therefore strongly urge my Venerable Brothers in the Episcopate, for whom the Catechism is 
primarily intended, to take the excellent opportunity afforded by the promulgation of this Latin 
edition to intensify their efforts to disseminate the text more widely and to ensure that it is well 
received as an outstanding gift for the communities entrusted to them, which will thus be able to 
rediscover the inexhaustible riches of the faith. 

Through the harmonious and complementary efforts of all the ranks of the People of God, may 
this Catechism be known and shared by everyone, so that the unity in faith whose supreme model 
and origin is found in the Unity of the Trinity may be strengthened and extended to the ends of the 
earth. 

To Mary, Mother of Christ, whose Assumption body and soul into heaven we celebrate today, 
I entrust these wishes so that they may be brought to fulfillment for the spiritual good of all 
humanity. 

From Castel Gandolfo, August 15, 1997, the nineteenth year of the Pontificate.

APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTION FIDEI 

DEPOSITUM 


ON THE PUBLICATION OF THE CATECHISM OF 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PREPARED 
FOLLOWING THE SECOND VATICAN 
ECUMENICAL COUNCIL 

JOHN PAUL, BISHOP SERVANT OF THE 
SERVANTS OF GOD FOR EVERLASTING 

MEMORY 

To my Venerable Brothers the Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, Deacons, and 
to all the People of God. 

Guarding the Deposit of Faith is the Mission Which the Lord Entrusted to his Church, and which 
she fulfills in every age. The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, which was opened 30 years ago 
by my predecessor Pope John XXIII, of happy memory, had as its intention and purpose to 
highlight the Church’s apostolic and pastoral mission and by making the truth of the Gospel shine 
forth to lead all people to seek and receive Christ’s love which surpasses all knowledge (cf. Eph 
3:19). 

The principal task entrusted to the Council by Pope John XXIII was to guard and present 
better the precious deposit of Christian doctrine in order to make it more accessible to the Christian 
faithful and to all people of good will. For this reason the Council was not first of all to condemn 
the errors of the time, but above all to strive calmly to show the strength and beauty of the doctrine 
of the faith. “Illumined by the light of this Council,” the Pope said, “the Church... will become 
greater in spiritual riches and gaining the strength of new energies therefrom, she will look to the 
future without fear.... Our duty is to dedicate ourselves with an earnest will and without fear to that 
work which our era demands of us, thus pursuing the path which the Church has followed for 20 
centuries.”! 

With the help of God, the Council Fathers in four years of work were able to produce a 
considerable number of doctrinal statements and pastoral norms which were presented to the whole 


Church. There the Pastors and Christian faithful find directives for that “renewal of thought, action, 
practices, and moral virtue, of joy and hope, which was the very purpose of the Council.”^ 

After its conclusion, the Council did not cease to inspire the Church’s life. In 1985 I was able 
to assert, “For me, then—who had the special grace of participating in it and actively collaborating 
in its development—Vatican II has always been, and especially during these years of my 
Pontificate, the constant reference point of my every pastoral action, in the conscious commitment 
to implement its directives concretely and faithfully at the level of each Church and the whole 
Church.”^ 

In this spirit, on January 25, 1985, I convoked an extraordinary assembly of the Synod of 
Bishops for the 20th anniversary of the close of the Council. The purpose of this assembly was to 
celebrate the graces and spiritual fruits of Vatican II, to study its teaching in greater depth in order 
that all the Christian faithful might better adhere to it and to promote knowledge and application of 
it. 

On that occasion the Synod Fathers stated: “Very many have expressed the desire that a 
catechism or compendium of all catholic doctrine regarding both faith and morals be composed, 
that it might be, as it were, a point of reference for the catechisms or compendiums that are 
prepared in various regions. The presentation of doctrine must be biblical and liturgical. It must be 
sound doctrine suited to the present life of Christians. ”4 After the Synod ended, I made this desire 
my own, considering it as “fully responding to a real need of the universal Church and of the 
particular Churches.”^ 

For this reason we thank the Lord wholeheartedly on this day when we can offer the entire 
Church this “reference text” entitled the Catechism of the Catholic Church for a catechesis renewed 
at the living sources of the faith! 

Following the renewal of the Liturgy and the new codification of the canon law of the Latin 
Church and that of the Oriental Catholic Churches, this catechism will make a very important 
contribution to that work of renewing the whole life of the Church, as desired and begun by the 
Second Vatican Council. 

1. The Process and Spirit of Drafting the Text 

The Catechism of the Catholic Church is the result of very extensive collaboration; it was prepared 
over six years of intense work done in a spirit of complete openness and fervent zeal. 

In 1986, I entrusted a commission of twelve Cardinals and Bishops, chaired by Cardinal Joseph 
Ratzinger, with the task of preparing a draft of the catechism requested by the Synod Fathers. An 
editorial committee of seven diocesan Bishops, experts in theology and catechesis, assisted the 


commission in its work. 

The commission, charged with giving directives and with overseeing the course of the work, 
attentively followed all the stages in editing the nine subsequent drafts. The editorial committee, for 
its part, assumed responsibility for writing the text, making the emendations requested by the 
commission and examining the observations of numerous theologians, exegetes and catechists, and, 
above all, of the Bishops of the whole world, in order to produce a better text. In the committee 
various opinions were compared with great profit, and thus a richer text has resulted whose unity 
and coherence are assured. 

The project was the object of extensive consultation among all Catholic Bishops, their 
Episcopal Conferences or Synods, and of theological and catechetical institutes. As a whole, it 
received a broadly favorable acceptance on the part of the Episcopate. It can be said that this 
Catechism is the result of the collaboration of the whole Episcopate of the Catholic Church, who 
generously accepted my invitation to share responsibility for an enterprise which directly concerns 
the life of the Church. This response elicits in me a deep feeling of joy, because the harmony of so 
many voices truly expresses what could be called the “symphony” of the faith. The achievement of 
this Catechism thus reflects the collegial nature of the Episcopate; it testifies to the Church’s 
catholicity. 

2. Arrangement of the Material 

A catechism should faithfully and systematically present the teaching of Sacred Scripture, the 
living Tradition in the Church and the authentic Magisterium, as well as the spiritual heritage of the 
Fathers, Doctors, and saints of the Church, to allow for a better knowledge of the Christian mystery 
and for enlivening the faith of the People of God. It should take into account the doctrinal 
statements which down the centuries the Holy Spirit has intimated to his Church. It should also 
help to illumine with the light of faith the new situations and problems which had not yet emerged 
in the past. 

This catechism will thus contain both the new and the old (cf. Mt 13:52), because the faith is 
always the same yet the source of ever new light. 

To respond to this twofold demand, the Catechism of the Catholic Church on the one hand 
repeats the “old,” traditional order already followed by the Catechism of St. Pius V, arranging the 
material in four parts: the Creed, the Sacred Liturgy, with pride of place given to the sacraments, 
the Christian way of life, explained beginning with the Ten Commandments, and finally, Christian 
prayer. At the same time, however, the contents are often presented in a “new” way in order to 
respond to the questions of our age. 



The four parts are related one to another: the Christian mystery is the object of faith (first 
part); it is celebrated and communicated in liturgical actions (second part); it is present to enlighten 
and sustain the children of God in their actions (third part); it is the basis for our prayer, the 
privileged expression of which is the Our Father, and it represents the object of our supplication, 
our praise and our intercession (fourth part). 

The Liturgy itself is prayer; the confession of faith finds its proper place in the celebration of 
worship. Grace, the fruit of the sacraments, is the irreplaceable condition for Christian living, just 
as participation in the Church’s Liturgy requires faith. If faith is not expressed in works, it is dead 
(cf. Jas 2:14-16) and cannot bear fruit unto eternal life. 

In reading the Catechism of the Catholic Church we can perceive the wonderful unity of the 
mystery of God, his saving will, as well as the central place of Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son 
of God, sent by the Father, made man in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary by the power of the 
Holy Spirit, to be our Savior. Having died and risen, Christ is always present in his Church, 
especially in the sacraments; he is the source of our faith, the model of Christian conduct, and the 
Teacher of our prayer. 

3. The Doctrinal Value of the Text 

The Catechism of the Catholic Church, which I approved June 25th last and the publication of 
which I today order by virtue of my Apostolic Authority, is a statement of the Church’s faith and of 
catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the Apostolic Tradition, and the 
Church’s Magisterium. I declare it to be a sure norm for teaching the faith and thus a valid and 
legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion. May it serve the renewal to which the Holy Spirit 
ceaselessly calls the Church of God, the Body of Christ, on her pilgrimage to the undiminished 
light of the Kingdom! 

The approval and publication of the Catechism of the Catholic Church represent a service 
which the Successor of Peter wishes to offer to the Holy Catholic Church, to all the particular 
Churches in peace and communion with the Apostolic See: the service, that is, of supporting and 
confirming the faith of all the Lord Jesus’ disciples (cf. Lk 22:32), as well as of strengthening the 
bonds of unity in the same apostolic faith. 

Therefore, I ask all the Church’s Pastors and the Christian faithful to receive this catechism in 
a spirit of communion and to use it assiduously in fulfilling their mission of proclaiming the faith 
and calling people to the Gospel life. This catechism is given to them that it may be a sure and 
authentic reference text for teaching catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local 
catechisms. It is also offered to all the faithful who wish to deepen their knowledge of the 



unfathomable riches of salvation (cf. Eph 3:8). It is meant to support ecumenical efforts that are 
moved by the holy desire for the unity of all Christians, showing carefully the content and 
wondrous harmony of the catholic faith. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, lastly, is offered to 
every individual who asks us to give an account of the hope that is in us (cf. 1 Pet 3:15) and who 
wants to know what the Catholic Church believes. 

This catechism is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the 
ecclesiastical authorities, the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences, especially if they 
have been approved by the Apostolic See. It is meant to encourage and assist in the writing of new 
local catechisms, which take into account various situations and cultures, while carefully preserving 
the unity of faith and fidelity to catholic doctrine. 

At the conclusion of this document presenting the Catechism of the Catholic Church, I 
beseech the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Incarnate Word and Mother of the Church, to 
support with her powerful intercession the catechetical work of the entire Church on every level, at 
this time when she is called to a new effort of evangelization. May the light of the true faith free 
humanity from the ignorance and slavery of sin in order to lead it to the only freedom worthy of the 
name (cf. Jn 8:32): that of life in Jesus Christ under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, here below and 
in the Kingdom of heaven, in the fullness of the blessed vision of God face to face (cf. 1 Cor 13:12; 
2 Cor 5:6-8)! 

Given October 11, 1992, the thirtieth anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican 
Ecumenical Council, in the fourteenth year of my Pontificate.

PROLOGUE 


“FATHER,... this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ 
whom you have sent.’d “God our Savior desires all men to be saved and to come to the 
knowledge of the truth.”2 “There is no other name under heaven given among men by which 
we must be saved”^ than the name of JESUS. 

I. The Life of Man—To Know and Love God 

1 God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to 
make him share in his own blessed life. For this reason, at every time and in every place, God 
draws close to man. He calls man to seek him, to know him, to love him with all his strength. He 
calls together all men, scattered and divided by sin, into the unity of his family, the Church. To 
accomplish this, when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son as Redeemer and Savior. In 
his Son and through him, he invites men to become, in the Holy Spirit, his adopted children and 
thus heirs of his blessed life. 

2 So that this call should resound throughout the world, Christ sent forth the apostles he had 
chosen, commissioning them to proclaim the gospel: “Go therefore and make disciples of all 
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching 
them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the 
age. ”4 Strengthened by this mission, the apostles “went forth and preached everywhere, while the 
Ford worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it.”^ 

3 Those who with God’s help have welcomed Christ’s call and freely responded to it are urged on 
by love of Christ to proclaim the Good News everywhere in the world. This treasure, received from 
the apostles, has been faithfully guarded by their successors. All Christ’s faithful are called to hand 
it on from generation to generation, by professing the faith, by living it in fraternal sharing, and by 
celebrating it in liturgy and prayer. § 

II. Handing on the Faith: Catechesis 

4 Quite early on, the name catechesis was given to the totality of the Church’s efforts to make 
disciples, to help men believe that Jesus is the Son of God so that believing they might have life in 



his name, and to educate and instruct them in this life, thus building up the body of Christ.^ 

5 “Catechesis is an education in the faith of children, young people, and adults which includes 
especially the teaching of Christian doctrine imparted, generally speaking, in an organic and 
systematic way, with a view to initiating the hearers into the fullness of Christian life.”§ 

6 While not being formally identified with them, catechesis is built on a certain number of elements 
of the Church’s pastoral mission which have a catechetical aspect, that prepare for catechesis, or 
spring from it. They are: the initial proclamation of the Gospel or missionary preaching to arouse 
faith; examination of the reasons for belief; experience of Christian living; celebration of the 
sacraments; integration into the ecclesial community; and apostolic and missionary witness .2 

7 “Catechesis is intimately bound up with the whole of the Church’s life. Not only her geographical 
extension and numerical increase, but even more her inner growth and correspondence with God’s 
plan depend essentially on catechesis.”^ 

8 Periods of renewal in the Church are also intense moments of catechesis. In the great era of the 
Fathers of the Church, saintly bishops devoted an important part of their ministry to catechesis. St. 
Cyril of Jerusalem and St. John Chrysostom, St. Ambrose and St. Augustine, and many other 
Fathers wrote catechetical works that remain models for us.TL 

9 “The ministry of catechesis draws ever fresh energy from the councils. The Council of Trent is a 
noteworthy example of this. It gave catechesis priority in its constitutions and decrees. It lies at the 
origin of the Roman Catechism, which is also known by the name of that council and which is a 
work of the first rank as a summary of Christian teaching....”^ The Council of Trent initiated a 
remarkable organization of the Church’s catechesis. Thanks to the work of holy bishops and 
theologians such as St. Peter Canisius, St. Charles Borromeo, St. Turibius of Mongrovejo, or St. 
Robert Bellarmine, it occasioned the publication of numerous catechisms. 

10 It is therefore no surprise that catechesis in the Church has again attracted attention in the wake 
of the Second Vatican Council, which Pope Paul VI considered the great catechism of modern 
times. The General Catechetical Directory (1971), the sessions of the Synod of Bishops devoted to 
evangelization (1974) and catechesis (1977), the apostolic exhortations Evangelii nuntiandi (1975) 
and Catechesi tradendae (1979) attest to this. The Extraordinary Synod of Bishops in 1985 asked 
“that a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding both faith and morals be 
composed.”^ The Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, made the Synod’s wish his own, acknowledging 
that “this desire wholly corresponds to a real need of the universal Church and of the particular 


Churches. ”14 He set in motion everything needed to carry out the Synod Fathers’ wish. 


III. The Aim and Intended Readership of this 
Catechism 

11 This catechism aims at presenting an organic synthesis of the essential and fundamental contents 
of Catholic doctrine, as regards both faith and morals, in the light of the Second Vatican Council 
and the whole of the Church’s Tradition. Its principal sources are the Sacred Scriptures, the Fathers 
of the Church, the liturgy, and the Church’s Magisterium. It is intended to serve “as a point of 
reference for the catechisms or compendia that are composed in the various countries.”!^ 

12 This work is intended primarily for those responsible for catechesis: first of all the bishops, as 
teachers of the faith and pastors of the Church. It is offered to them as an instrument in fulfilling 
their responsibility of teaching the People of God. Through the bishops, it is addressed to redactors 
of catechisms, to priests, and to catechists. It will also be useful reading for all other Christian 
faithful. 

IV. Structure of This Catechism 

13 The plan of this catechism is inspired by the great tradition of catechisms which build catechesis 
on four pillars: the baptismal profession of faith (the Creed), the sacraments of faith, the life of faith 
(the Commandments), and the prayer of the believer (the Lord’s Prayer). 

Part One: The profession of faith 

14 Those who belong to Christ through faith and Baptism must confess their baptismal faith before 
men.l£ First therefore the Catechism expounds revelation, by which God addresses and gives 
himself to man, and the faith by which man responds to God ( Section One). The profession of faith 
summarizes the gifts that God gives man: as the Author of all that is good; as Redeemer; and as 
Sanctifier. It develops these in the three chapters on our baptismal faith in the one God: the 
almighty Father, the Creator; his Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior; and the Holy Spirit, the 
Sanctifier, in the Holy Church ( Section Two). 

Part Two: The sacraments of faith 

15 The second part of the Catechism explains how God’s salvation, accomplished once for all 


through Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit, is made present in the sacred actions of the Church’s 
liturgy ( Section One), especially in the seven sacraments ( Section Two). 


Part Three: The life of faith 

16 The third part of the Catechism deals with the final end of man created in the image of God: 
beatitude, and the ways of reaching it—through right conduct freely chosen, with the help of God’s 
law and grace (Section One), and through conduct that fulfills the twofold commandment of 
charity, specified in God’s Ten Commandments (Section Two). 

Part Four: Prayer in the life of faith 

17 The last part of the Catechism deals with the meaning and importance of prayer in the life of 
believers (Section One). It concludes with a brief commentary on the seven petitions of the Lord’s 
Prayer (Section Two), for indeed we find in these the sum of all the good things which we must 
hope for and which our heavenly Father wants to grant us. 

V. Practical Directions for Using This Catechism 

18 This catechism is conceived as an organic presentation of the Catholic faith in its entirety. It 
should be seen therefore as a unified whole. Numerous cross-references in the margin of the text 
(italicized numbers referring to other paragraphs that deal with the same theme), as well as the 
analytical index at the end of the volume, allow the reader to view each theme in its relationship 
with the entirety of the faith. 

19 The texts of Sacred Scripture are often not quoted word for word but are merely indicated by a 
reference (cf.). For a deeper understanding of such passages, the reader should refer to the 
Scriptural texts themselves. Such Biblical references are a valuable working-tool in catechesis. 

20 The use of small print in certain passages indicates observations of an historical or apologetic 
nature, or supplementary doctrinal explanations. 

(PUBLISHER’S NOTE: This applies to print edition only.) 

21 The quotations, also in small print, from patristic, liturgical, magisterial or hagiographical 
sources, are intended to enrich the doctrinal presentations. These texts have often been chosen with 
a view to direct catechetical use. 



22 At the end of each thematic unit, a series of brief texts sum up the essentials of that unit’s 
teaching in condensed formulae. These IN BRIEF summaries may suggest to local catechists brief 
summary formulae that could be memorized. 

VI. Necessary Adaptations 

23 The Catechism emphasizes the exposition of doctrine. It seeks to help deepen understanding of 
faith. In this way it is oriented toward the maturing of that faith, its putting down roots in personal 
life and its shining forth in personal conduct.!^ 

24 By design, this Catechism does not set out to provide the adaptation of doctrinal presentations 
and catechetical methods required by the differences of culture, age, spiritual maturity, and social 
and ecclesial condition among all those to whom it is addressed. Such indispensable adaptations are 
the responsibility of particular catechisms and, even more, of those who instruct the faithful: 

Whoever teaches must become “all things to all men” (1 Cor 9:22), to win everyone to 
Christ.... Above all, teachers must not imagine that a single kind of soul has been entrusted to 
them, and that consequently it is lawful to teach and form equally all the faithful in true piety 
with one and the same method! Let them realize that some are in Christ as newborn babes, 
others as adolescents, and still others as adults in full command of their powers.... Those who 
are called to the ministry of preaching must suit their words to the maturity and understanding 
of their hearers, as they hand on the teaching of the mysteries of faith and the rules of moral 

conduct.^ 

Above All—Charity 

25 To conclude this Prologue, it is fitting to recall this pastoral principle stated by the Roman 
Catechism: 

The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends. 
Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope or for action, the love of our Lord must 
always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue 
spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love.12

PART ONE 

THE PROFESSION OF FAITH 



SECTION ONE 

“I BELIEVE” — “WE BELIEVE” 

26 We begin our profession of faith by saying: “I believe” or “We believe.” Before expounding the 
Church’s faith, as confessed in the Creed, celebrated in the liturgy, and lived in observance of 
God’s commandments and in prayer, we must first ask what “to believe” means. Faith is man’s 
response to God, who reveals himself and gives himself to man, at the same time bringing man a 
superabundant light as he searches for the ultimate meaning of his life. Thus we shall consider first 
that search (Chapter One), then the divine Revelation by which God comes to meet man (Chapter 
Two), and finally the response of faith (Chapter Three). 



CHAPTER ONE 
MAN’S CAPACITY FOR GOD 


I. The Desire for God 

27 The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; 
and God never ceases to draw man to himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he 
never stops searching for: (355, 170, 1718 1 

The dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called to communion with God. This 
invitation to converse with God is addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. For if 
man exists, it is because God has created him through love, and through love continues to hold 
him in existence. He cannot live fully according to truth unless he freely acknowledges that 
love and entrusts himself to his creator.! 

28 In many ways, throughout history down to the present day, men have given expression to their 
quest for God in their religious beliefs and behavior: in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations, 
and so forth. These forms of religious expression, despite the ambiguities they often bring with 
them, are so universal that one may well call man a religious being: (843, 2566 . 2095-2109 1 

From one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times 
of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would 
search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him—though indeed he is not far from 
each one of us. For “in him we live and move and have our being.”! 

29 But this “intimate and vital bond of man to God” (GS 19,1) can be forgotten, overlooked, or 
even explicitly rejected by man.! Such attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in the 
world; religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of this world; the scandal of bad 
example on the part of believers; currents of thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of 
sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.! [ 2123-2128 . 398 ] 

30 “Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.”! Although man can forget God or reject 
him, He never ceases to call every man to seek him, so as to find life and happiness. But this search 
for God demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound will, “an upright heart,” as well as the 
witness of others who teach him to seek God. [ 2567 . 845 . 368 ] 













You are great, O Lord, and greatly to be praised: great is your power and your wisdom is 
without measure. And man, so small a part of your creation, wants to praise you: this man, 
though clothed with mortality and bearing the evidence of sin and the proof that you withstand 
the proud. Despite everything, man, though but a small part of your creation, wants to praise 
you. You yourself encourage him to delight in your praise, for you have made us for yourself, 
and our heart is restless until it rests in you.§ 

II. Ways of Coming to Know God 

31 Created in God’s image and called to know and love him, the person who seeks God discovers 
certain ways of coming to know him. These are also called proofs for the existence of God, not in 
the sense of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the sense of “converging and convincing 
arguments,” which allow us to attain certainty about the truth. 

These “ways” of approaching God from creation have a twofold point of departure: the 
physical world and the human person. 

32 The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and the world’s order and beauty, 
one can come to a knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe. (54, 337) 

As St. Paul says of the Gentiles: For what can be known about God is plain to them, because 
God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his 
eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made.Z 

And St. Augustine issues this challenge: Question the beauty of the earth, question the beauty 
of the sea, question the beauty of the air distending and diffusing itself, question the beauty of 
the sky... question all these realities. All respond: “See, we are beautiful.” Their beauty is a 
profession [ confessio ]. These beauties are subject to change. Who made them if not the 
Beautiful One [ Pulcher ] who is not subject to change?^ 

33 The human person: With his openness to truth and beauty, his sense of moral goodness, his 
freedom and the voice of his conscience, with his longings for the infinite and for happiness, man 
questions himself about God’s existence. In all this he discerns signs of his spiritual soul. The soul, 
the “seed of eternity we bear in ourselves, irreducible to the merely material, ”9 can have its origin 
only in God. 1 2500 . 1730 . 1776 . 1703 . 366 1 

34 The world, and man, attest that they contain within themselves neither their first principle nor 
their final end, but rather that they participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or end. 








Thus, in different ways, man can come to know that there exists a reality which is the first cause 
and final end of all things, a reality “that everyone calls ‘God.’”lS (199) 

35 Man’s faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God. 
But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to 
man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith. The proofs of 
God’s existence, however, can predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed 
to reason. (50, 159) 

III. The Knowledge of God According to the Church 

36 “Our holy mother, the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first principle and last end of all 
things, can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason.”3T 
Without this capacity, man would not be able to welcome God’s revelation. Man has this capacity 
because he is created “in the image of God.”12 (355) 

37 In the historical conditions in which he finds himself, however, man experiences many 
difficulties in coming to know God by the light of reason alone: (I960) 

Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of 
attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and 
controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the 
Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use 
of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly 
transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and 
influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is 
hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the 
imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it 
happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to 
be true is false or at least doubtful.^ 

38 This is why man stands in need of being enlightened by God’s revelation, not only about those 
things that exceed his understanding, but also “about those religious and moral truths which of 
themselves are not beyond the grasp of human reason, so that even in the present condition of the 
human race, they can be known by all men with ease, with firm certainty and with no admixture of 
error.”14 ( 2036 ) 







IV. How Can We Speak about God? 


39 In defending the ability of human reason to know God, the Church is expressing her confidence 
in the possibility of speaking about him to all men and with all men, and therefore of dialogue with 
other religions, with philosophy and science, as well as with unbelievers and atheists. (851) 

40 Since our knowledge of God is limited, our language about him is equally so. We can name God 
only by taking creatures as our starting point, and in accordance with our limited human ways of 
knowing and thinking. 

41 All creatures bear a certain resemblance to God, most especially man, created in the image and 
likeness of God. The manifold perfections of creatures—their truth, their goodness, their beauty— 
all reflect the infinite perfection of God. Consequently we can name God by taking his creatures’ 
perfections as our starting point, “for from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a 
corresponding perception of their Creator.”^ (213, 299 1 

42 God transcends all creatures. We must therefore continually purify our language of everything in 
it that is limited, image-bound or imperfect, if we are not to confuse our image of God — “the 
inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the invisible, the ungraspable” — with our human 
representations.^ Our human words always fall short of the mystery of God. (212, 300, 370 1 

43 Admittedly, in speaking about God like this, our language is using human modes of expression; 
nevertheless it really does attain to God himself, though unable to express him in his infinite 
simplicity. Likewise, we must recall that “between Creator and creature no similitude can be 
expressed without implying an even greater dissimilitude” ;^ 7 and that “concerning God, we cannot 
grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to him.”i^ ( 206 1 


IN BRIEF 

44 Man is by nature and vocation a religious being. Coming from God, going toward God, man 
lives a fully human life only if he freely lives by his bond with God. 

45 Man is made to live in communion with God in whom he finds happiness: “When I am 
completely united to you, there will be no more sorrow or trials; entirely full of you, my life will be 
complete” (St. Augustine, Conf. 10, 28, 39: PL 32, 795). 












46 When he listens to the message of creation and to the voice of conscience, man can arrive at 
certainty about the existence of God, the cause and the end of everything. 

47 The Church teaches that the one true God, our Creator and Lord, can be known with certainty 
from his works, by the natural light of human reason (cf. Vatican Council I, can. 2, § 1: DS 3026). 

48 We really can name God, starting from the manifold perfections of his creatures, which are 
likenesses of the infinitely perfect God, even if our limited language cannot exhaust the mystery. 

49 “Without the Creator, the creature vanishes” (GS 36). This is the reason why believers know that 
the love of Christ urges them to bring the light of the living God to those who do not know him or 
who reject him.

CHAPTER TWO 
GOD COMES TO MEET MAN 


50 By natural reason man can know God with certainty, on the basis of his works. But there is 
another order of knowledge, which man cannot possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of 
divine Revelation.^ Through an utterly free decision, God has revealed himself and given himself 
to man. This he does by revealing the mystery, his plan of loving goodness, formed from all 
eternity in Christ, for the benefit of all men. God has fully revealed this plan by sending us his 
beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. (36, 1066 1 

ARTICLE 1 

THE REVELATION OF GOD 


I. God Reveals His “Plan of Loving Goodness” 

51 “It pleased God, in his goodness and wisdom, to reveal himself and to make known the mystery 
of his will. His will was that men should have access to the Father, through Christ, the Word made 
flesh, in the Holy Spirit, and thus become sharers in the divine nature. ”2 (2823, 1996 1 

52 God, who “dwells in unapproachable light,” wants to communicate his own divine life to the 
men he freely created, in order to adopt them as his sons in his only-begotten Son.2 By revealing 
himself God wishes to make them capable of responding to him, and of knowing him, and of loving 
him far beyond their own natural capacity. 

53 The divine plan of Revelation is realized simultaneously “by deeds and words which are 
intrinsically bound up with each other”4 and shed light on each other. It involves a specific divine 
pedagogy: God communicates himself to man gradually. He prepares him to welcome by stages the 
supernatural Revelation that is to culminate in the person and mission of the incarnate Word, Jesus 
Christ. 1 1953 . 1950 1 

St. Irenaeus of Lyons repeatedly speaks of this divine pedagogy using the image of God and 
man becoming accustomed to one another: The Word of God dwelt in man and became the 
Son of man in order to accustom man to perceive God and to accustom God to dwell in man, 
according to the Father’s pleasure. ^ 


II. The Stages of Revelation 









In the beginning God makes himself known 


54 “God, who creates and conserves all things by his Word, provides men with constant evidence 
of himself in created realities. And furthermore, wishing to open up the way to heavenly salvation, 
he manifested himself to our first parents from the very beginning.”^ He invited them to intimate 
communion with himself and clothed them with resplendent grace and justice. (32, 374) 

55 This revelation was not broken off by our first parents’ sin. “After the fall, [God] buoyed them 
up with the hope of salvation, by promising redemption; and he has never ceased to show his 
solicitude for the human race. For he wishes to give eternal life to all those who seek salvation by 
patience in well-doing.”^ [ 397 . 410 . 761 ] 

Even when he disobeyed you and lost your friendship you did not abandon him to the power 
of death.... Again and again you offered a covenant to man.2 

The Covenant with Noah 

56 After the unity of the human race was shattered by sin God at once sought to save humanity part 
by part. The covenant with Noah after the flood gives expression to the principle of the divine 
economy toward the “nations,” in other words, toward men grouped “in their lands, each with [its] 
own language, by their families, in their nations. ”2 (401, 1219 ] 

57 This state of division into many nations is at once cosmic, social, and religious. It is intended to 
limit the pride of fallen humanity, ^ united only in its perverse ambition to forge its own unity as at 
Babel M But, because of sin, both polytheism and the idolatry of the nation and of its rulers 
constantly threaten this provisional economy with the perversion of paganism. ^ 

58 The covenant with Noah remains in force during the times of the Gentiles, until the universal 
proclamation of the Gospel.12 The Bible venerates several great figures among the Gentiles: Abel 
the just, the king-priest Melchizedek—a figure of Christ—and the upright “Noah, Daniel, and 
Job.”Tf Scripture thus expresses the heights of sanctity that can be reached by those who live 
according to the covenant of Noah, waiting for Christ to “gather into one the children of God who 
are scattered abroad.”^ (674, 2569 ] 

God chooses Abraham 


59 In order to gather together scattered humanity God calls Abram from his country, his kindred, 










and his father’s housed and makes him Abraham, that is, “the father of a multitude of nations.” 
“In you all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.”^ ( 145 . 2570 1 

60 The people descended from Abraham would be the trustees of the promise made to the 
patriarchs, the chosen people, called to prepare for that day when God would gather all his children 
into the unity of the Church.^ They would be the root onto which the Gentiles would be grafted, 
once they came to believe.^ (760, 762, 781 1 

61 The patriarchs, prophets, and certain other Old Testament figures have been and always will be 
honored as saints in all the Church’s liturgical traditions. 

God forms his people Israel 

62 After the patriarchs, God formed Israel as his people by freeing them from slavery in Egypt. He 
established with them the covenant of Mount Sinai and, through Moses, gave them his law so that 
they would recognize him and serve him as the one living and true God, the provident Father and 
just judge, and so that they would look for the promised Savior M 1 2060 . 2574 . 1961 1 

63 Israel is the priestly people of God, “called by the name of the LORD,” and “the first to hear the 
word of God, ”21 the people of “elder brethren” in the faith of Abraham. ( 204 . 2801 . 839 1 

64 Through the prophets, God forms his people in the hope of salvation, in the expectation of a new 
and everlasting Covenant intended for all, to be written on their hearts.22 The prophets proclaim a 
radical redemption of the People of God, purification from all their infidelities, a salvation which 
will include all the nations.^ Above all, the poor and humble of the Lord will bear this hope. Such 
holy women as Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Judith, and Esther kept alive 
the hope of Israel’s salvation. The purest figure among them is Mary. 2d (711, 1965 . 489 1 

III. Christ Jesus — “Mediator and Fullness of All Revelation”25 

God has said everything in his Word 

65 “In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last 
days he has spoken to us by a Son.”2h Christ, the Son of God made man, is the Father’s one, 
perfect, and unsurpassable Word. In him he has said everything; there will be no other word than 
this one. St. John of the Cross, among others, commented strikingly on Hebrews 1:1-2: ( 102 . 516 . 
2717 1 



















In giving us his Son, his only Word (for he possesses no other), he spoke everything to us at 
once in this sole Word—and he has no more to say... because what he spoke before to the 
prophets in parts, he has now spoken all at once by giving us the All Who is His Son. Any 
person questioning God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty not only of 
foolish behavior but also of offending him, by not fixing his eyes entirely upon Christ and by 
living with the desire for some other novelty.^ 

There will be no further Revelation 

66 “The Christian economy, therefore, since it is the new and definitive Covenant, will never pass 
away; and no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of our Lord 
Jesus Christ.”2S Yet even if Revelation is already complete, it has not been made completely 
explicit; it remains for Christian faith gradually to grasp its full significance over the course of the 
centuries. (94) 

67 Throughout the ages, there have been so-called “private” revelations, some of which have been 
recognized by the authority of the Church. They do not belong, however, to the deposit of faith. It 
is not their role to improve or complete Christ’s definitive Revelation, but to help live more fully by 
it in a certain period of history. Guided by the magisterium of the Church, the sensus fidelium 
knows how to discern and welcome in these revelations whatever constitutes an authentic call of 
Christ or his saints to the Church. (84, 23) 

Christian faith cannot accept “revelations” that claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of 
which Christ is the fulfillment, as is the case in certain non-Christian religions and also in certain 
recent sects which base themselves on such “revelations.” 


IN BRIEF 

68 By love, God has revealed himself and given himself to man. He has thus provided the 
definitive, superabundant answer to the questions that man asks himself about the meaning and 
purpose of his life. 

69 God has revealed himself to man by gradually communicating his own mystery in deeds and in 
words. 


70 Beyond the witness to himself that God gives in created things, he manifested himself to our 




first parents, spoke to them and, after the fall, promised them salvation (cf. Gen 3:15) and offered 
them his covenant. 

71 God made an everlasting covenant with Noah and with all living beings (cf. Gen 9:16). It will 
remain in force as long as the world lasts. 

72 God chose Abraham and made a covenant with him and his descendants. By the covenant God 
formed his people and revealed his law to them through Moses. Through the prophets, he prepared 
them to accept the salvation destined for all humanity. 

73 God has revealed himself fully by sending his own Son, in whom he has established his 
covenant for ever. The Son is his Father’s definitive Word; so there will be no further Revelation 
after him. 


ARTICLE 2 

THE TRANSMISSION OF DIVINE REVELATION 


74 God “desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth”:22 that is, of Christ 
Jesus.^Q Christ must be proclaimed to all nations and individuals, so that this revelation may reach 
to the ends of the earth: (851) 

God graciously arranged that the things he had once revealed for the salvation of all peoples 
should remain in their entirety, throughout the ages, and be transmitted to all generations. 

I. The Apostolic Tradition 

75 “Christ the Lord, in whom the entire Revelation of the most high God is summed up, 
commanded the apostles to preach the Gospel, which had been promised beforehand by the 
prophets, and which he fulfilled in his own person and promulgated with his own lips. In preaching 
the Gospel, they were to communicate the gifts of God to all men. This Gospel was to be the source 
of all saving truth and moral discipline.”^ ( 171 1 

In the apostolic preaching... 


76 In keeping with the Lord’s command, the Gospel was handed on in two ways: 








— orally “by the apostles who handed on, by the spoken word of their preaching, by the 
example they gave, by the institutions they established, what they themselves had received 
—whether from the lips of Christ, from his way of life and his works, or whether they had 
learned it at the prompting of the Holy Spirit”;22 

— in writing “by those apostles and other men associated with the apostles who, under the 
inspiration of the same Holy Spirit, committed the message of salvation to writing. ”24 

...continued in apostolic succession 

77 “In order that the full and living Gospel might always be preserved in the Church the apostles 
left bishops as their successors. They gave them Their own position of teaching authority. ’”22 
Indeed, “the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special way in the inspired books, was to 
be preserved in a continuous line of succession until the end of time. ”22 ( 861 ) 

78 This living transmission, accomplished in the Holy Spirit, is called Tradition, since it is distinct 
from Sacred Scripture, though closely connected to it. Through Tradition, “the Church, in her 
doctrine, life, and worship perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that she herself is, all 
that she believes. ”22 “The sayings of the holy Fathers are a witness to the life-giving presence of 
this Tradition, showing how its riches are poured out in the practice and life of the Church, in her 
belief and her prayer.”22 ( 174 . 1124 . 2651 1 

79 The Father’s self-communication made through his Word in the Holy Spirit, remains present 
and active in the Church: “God, who spoke in the past, continues to converse with the Spouse of his 
beloved Son. And the Holy Spirit, through whom the living voice of the Gospel rings out in the 
Church—and through her in the world—leads believers to the full truth, and makes the Word of 
Christ dwell in them in ah its richness. ”22 

II. The Relationship Between Tradition and Sacred Scripture 

One common source... 

80 “Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely together and communicate one 
with the other. For both of them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in 
some fashion to form one thing and move towards the same goal. ”42 Each of them makes present 
and fruitful in the Church the mystery of Christ, who promised to remain with his own “always, to 
the close of the age. ”41 






...two distinct modes of transmission 


81 “Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in writing under the breath of the Holy 
Spirit. ”42 (113) 

“And [Holy] Tradition transmits in its entirety the Word of God which has been entrusted to 
the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit. It transmits it to the successors of the apostles 
so that, enlightened by the Spirit of truth, they may faithfully preserve, expound, and spread it 
abroad by their preaching. ”42 

82 As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, 
“does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both 
Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honored with equal sentiments of devotion and 
reverence. ”44 

Apostolic Tradition and ecclesial traditions 

83 The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands on what they received from 
Jesus’ teaching and example and what they learned from the Holy Spirit. The first generation of 
Christians did not yet have a written New Testament, and the New Testament itself demonstrates 
the process of living Tradition. ( 1202 . 2041 . 2684 1 

Tradition is to be distinguished from the various theological, disciplinary, liturgical, or 
devotional traditions, born in the local churches over time. These are the particular forms, adapted 
to different places and times, in which the great Tradition is expressed. In the light of Tradition, 
these traditions can be retained, modified or even abandoned under the guidance of the Church’s 
magisterium. 

III. The Interpretation of the Heritage of Faith 

The heritage of faith entrusted to the whole of the Church 

84 The apostles entrusted the “Sacred deposit” of the faith (the depositum fidei), 42 contained in 
Sacred Scripture and Tradition, to the whole of the Church. “By adhering to [this heritage] the 
entire holy people, united to its pastors, remains always faithful to the teaching of the apostles, to 
the brotherhood, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. So, in maintaining, practicing, and 
professing the faith that has been handed on, there should be a remarkable harmony between the 
bishops and the faithful. ”46 (857, 871, 2033 1 


The Magisterium of the Church 









85 “The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God, whether in its written form 
or in the form of Tradition, has been entrusted to the living, teaching office of the Church alone. Its 
authority in this matter is exercised in the name of Jesus Christ. This means that the task of 
interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the 
Bishop of Rome. 1 888-892 . 2032-2040 1 

86 “Yet this Magisterium is not superior to the Word of God, but is its servant. It teaches only what 
has been handed on to it. At the divine command and with the help of the Holy Spirit, it listens to 
this devotedly, guards it with dedication, and expounds it faithfully. All that it proposes for belief 
as being divinely revealed is drawn from this single deposit of faith.”42 1 688 1 

87 Mindful of Christ’s words to his apostles: “He who hears you, hears me, ”42 the faithful receive 
with docility the teachings and directives that their pastors give them in different forms. 1 1548 . 
2037 1 

The dogmas of the faith 

88 The Church’s Magisterium exercises the authority it holds from Christ to the fullest extent when 
it defines dogmas, that is, when it proposes, in a form obliging the Christian people to an 
irrevocable adherence of faith, truths contained in divine Revelation or also when it proposes, in a 
definitive way, truths having a necessary connection with these. 1 888-892 . 2032-2040 1 

89 There is an organic connection between our spiritual life and the dogmas. Dogmas are lights 
along the path of faith; they illuminate it and make it secure. Conversely, if our life is upright, our 
intellect and heart will be open to welcome the light shed by the dogmas of faith.^2 ( 2625 1 

90 The mutual connections between dogmas, and their coherence, can be found in the whole of the 
Revelation of the mystery of Christ.^1 “In Catholic doctrine there exists an order or 'hierarchy’ of 
truths, since they vary in their relation to the foundation of the Christian faith.”22 1 114 . 158 . 234 1 

The supernatural sense of faith 

91 All the faithful share in understanding and handing on revealed truth. They have received the 
anointing of the Holy Spirit, who instructs them^S and guides them into all truth.24 1 737 1 

92 “The whole body of the faithful... cannot err in matters of belief. This characteristic is shown in 
the supernatural appreciation of faith (sensus fidei ) on the part of the whole people, when, 'from the 














bishops to the last of the faithful,’ they manifest a universal consent in matters of faith and 
morals.”^ (785) 


93 “By this appreciation of the faith, aroused and sustained by the Spirit of truth, the People of 
God, guided by the sacred teaching authority ( Magisterium ),... receives... the faith, once for all 
delivered to the saints.... The People unfailingly adheres to this faith, penetrates it more deeply with 
right judgment, and applies it more fully in daily life.”S§ (889) 

Growth in understanding the faith 

94 Thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of both the realities and the words 
of the heritage of faith is able to grow in the life of the Church: (66, 2651 . 2038 . 2518) 

— “through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their 
hearts”;^ it is in particular “theological research [which] deepens knowledge of revealed 
truth. 

— “from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which [believers] experience,”^ the sacred 
Scriptures “grow with the one who reads them.”^ 

— “from the preaching of those who have received, along with their right of succession in the 

episcopate, the sure charism of truth.”^! 

95 “It is clear therefore that, in the supremely wise arrangement of God, sacred Tradition, Sacred 
Scripture, and the Magisterium of the Church are so connected and associated that one of them 
cannot stand without the others. Working together, each in its own way, under the action of the one 
Holy Spirit, they all contribute effectively to the salvation of souls. 


IN BRIEF 

96 What Christ entrusted to the apostles, they in turn handed on by their preaching and writing, 
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, to all generations, until Christ returns in glory. 

97 “Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God” 
(DV 10), in which, as in a mirror, the pilgrim Church contemplates God, the source of all her 
riches. 

98 “The Church, in her doctrine, life, and worship, perpetuates and transmits to every generation all 









that she herself is, all that she believes” (DV 8 §1). 


99 Thanks to its supernatural sense of faith, the People of God as a whole never ceases to welcome, 
to penetrate more deeply, and to live more fully from the gift of divine Revelation. 

100 The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically has been entrusted solely to the 
Magisterium of the Church, that is, to the Pope and to the bishops in communion with him. 


ARTICLE 3 

SACRED SCRIPTURE 


I. Christ—The Unique Word of Sacred Scripture 

101 In order to reveal himself to men, in the condescension of his goodness God speaks to them in 
human words: “Indeed the words of God, expressed in the words of men, are in every way like 
human language, just as the Word of the eternal Father, when he took on himself the flesh of 
human weakness, became like men.”h3 

102 Through all the words of Sacred Scripture, God speaks only one single Word, his one 
Utterance in whom he expresses himself completely:^ (65, 2763 . 426-429 1 

You recall that one and the same Word of God extends throughout Scripture, that it is one and 
the same Utterance that resounds in the mouths of all the sacred writers, since he who was in 
the beginning God with God has no need of separate syllables; for he is not subject to time.hS 

103 For this reason, the Church has always venerated the Scriptures as she venerates the Lord’s 
Body. She never ceases to present to the faithful the bread of life, taken from the one table of God’s 
Word and Christ’s Body.^ (1100,1184, 1378 1 

104 In Sacred Scripture, the Church constantly finds her nourishment and her strength, for she 
welcomes it not as a human word, “but as what it really is, the word of God.”^ “In the sacred 
books, the Father who is in heaven comes lovingly to meet his children, and talks with them.”^ 

II. Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture 


105 God is the author of Sacred Scripture. “The divinely revealed realities, which are contained 














and presented in the text of Sacred Scripture, have been written down under the inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit.”^ 

“For Holy Mother Church, relying on the faith of the apostolic age, accepts as sacred and 
canonical the books of the Old and the New Testaments, whole and entire, with all their parts, on 
the grounds that, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they have God as their author and 
have been handed on as such to the Church herself.”2Q 

106 God inspired the human authors of the sacred books. “To compose the sacred books, God 
chose certain men who, all the while he employed them in this task, made full use of their own 
faculties and powers so that, though he acted in them and by them, it was as true authors that they 
consigned to writing whatever he wanted written, and no more. ”21 

107 The inspired books teach the truth. “Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred 
writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the 
books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of 
our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures. ”22 ( 702 ) 

108 Still, the Christian faith is not a “religion of the book.” Christianity is the religion of the 
“Word” of God, a word which is “not a written and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate 
and living.”23 If the Scriptures are not to remain a dead letter, Christ, the eternal Word of the living 
God, must, through the Holy Spirit, “open [our] minds to understand the Scriptures.”24 

III. The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture 

109 In Sacred Scripture, God speaks to man in a human way. To interpret Scripture correctly, the 
reader must be attentive to what the human authors truly wanted to affirm and to what God wanted 
to reveal to us by their words. 22 

110 In order to discover the sacred authors’ intention, the reader must take into account the 
conditions of their time and culture, the literary genres in use at that time, and the modes of feeling, 
speaking, and narrating then current. “For the fact is that truth is differently presented and 
expressed in the various types of historical writing, in prophetical and poetical texts, and in other 
forms of literary expression.”^ 

111 But since Sacred Scripture is inspired, there is another and no less important principle of 
correct interpretation, without which Scripture would remain a dead letter. “Sacred Scripture must 
be read and interpreted in the light of the same Spirit by whom it was written.”22 



The Second Vatican Council indicates three criteria for interpreting Scripture in accordance 
with the Spirit who inspired it.ZS 

112 1. Be especially attentive “to the content and unity of the whole Scripture.” Different as the 
books which comprise it may be, Scripture is a unity by reason of the unity of God’s plan, of which 
Christ Jesus is the center and heart, open since his Passover.^ ( 128 . 368) 

The phrase “heart of Christ” can refer to Sacred Scripture, which makes known his heart, 
closed before the Passion, as the Scripture was obscure. But the Scripture has been opened 
since the Passion; since those who from then on have understood it, consider and discern in 
what way the prophecies must be interpreted.^ 

113 2. Read the Scripture within “the living Tradition of the whole Church.” According to a saying 
of the Fathers, Sacred Scripture is written principally in the Church’s heart rather than in 
documents and records, for the Church carries in her Tradition the living memorial of God’s Word, 
and it is the Holy Spirit who gives her the spiritual interpretation of the Scripture (“according to the 
spiritual meaning which the Spirit grants to the Church”£l). (81) 

114 3. Be attentive to the analogy of faithM By “analogy of faith” we mean the coherence of the 
truths of faith among themselves and within the whole plan of Revelation. (90) 

The senses of Scripture 

115 According to an ancient tradition, one can distinguish between two senses of Scripture: the 
literal and the spiritual, the latter being subdivided into the allegorical, moral, and anagogical 
senses. The profound concordance of the four senses guarantees all its richness to the living reading 
of Scripture in the Church. 

116 The literal sense is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture and discovered by 
exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation: “All other senses of Sacred Scripture are 
based on the literal.”^ (110-114 1 

117 The spiritual sense. Thanks to the unity of God’s plan, not only the text of Scripture but also 
the realities and events about which it speaks can be signs. ( 1101 1 

1. The allegorical sense. We can acquire a more profound understanding of events by 
recognizing their significance in Christ; thus the crossing of the Red Sea is a sign or type of 






Christ’s victory and also of Christian Baptism.^ 

2. The moral sense. The events reported in Scripture ought to lead us to act justly. As St. Paul 
says, they were written “for our instruction.”^ 

3. The anagogical sense (Greek: anagoge, “leading”). We can view realities and events in terms 
of their eternal significance, leading us toward our true homeland: thus the Church on earth is 
a sign of the heavenly Jerusalem.^ 

118 A medieval couplet summarizes the significance of the four senses: 

The Letter speaks of deeds; Allegory to faith; 

The Moral how to act; Anagogy our destiny.^ 

119 “It is the task of exegetes to work, according to these rules, toward a better understanding and 
explanation of the meaning of Sacred Scripture in order that their research may help the Church to 
form a firmer judgment. For, of course, all that has been said about the manner of interpreting 
Scripture is ultimately subject to the judgment of the Church which exercises the divinely conferred 
commission and ministry of watching over and interpreting the Word of God.”^ (94, 113) 

But I would not believe in the Gospel, had not the authority of the Catholic Church already 
moved me.^ 

IV. The Canon of Scripture 

120 It was by the apostolic Tradition that the Church discerned which writings are to be included in 
the list of the sacred books.^S This complete list is called the canon of Scripture. It includes 46 
books for the Old Testament (45 if we count Jeremiah and Lamentations as one) and 27 for the 
New.— (1H7) 

The Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, 
Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, 
Esther, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, the Wisdom of 
Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Baruch, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, 
Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and 
Malachi. 

The New Testament: the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the Acts of the 
Apostles, the Letters of St. Paul to the Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, 
Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, the Letter to the 




Hebrews, the Letters of James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, and Jude, and Revelation (the 
Apocalypse). 

The Old Testament 

121 The Old Testament is an indispensable part of Sacred Scripture. Its books are divinely inspired 
and retain a permanent valued for the Old Covenant has never been revoked. ( 1093 ) 

122 Indeed, “the economy of the Old Testament was deliberately so oriented that it should prepare 
for and declare in prophecy the coming of Christ, redeemer of all men. ”22 “Even though they 
contain matters imperfect and provisional,”^ the books of the Old Testament bear witness to the 
whole divine pedagogy of God’s saving love: these writings “are a storehouse of sublime teaching 
on God and of sound wisdom on human life, as well as a wonderful treasury of prayers; in them, 
too, the mystery of our salvation is present in a hidden way.”2S (702, Z63, 708, 2568 1 

123 Christians venerate the Old Testament as true Word of God. The Church has always vigorously 
opposed the idea of rejecting the Old Testament under the pretext that the New has rendered it void 
(Marcionism). 

The New Testament 

124 “The Word of God, which is the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, is set 
forth and displays its power in a most wonderful way in the writings of the New Testament”^ 
which hand on the ultimate truth of God’s Revelation. Their central object is Jesus Christ, God’s 
incarnate Son: his acts, teachings, Passion and glorification, and his Church’s beginnings under the 
Spirit’s guidance.^ 

125 The Gospels are the heart of all the Scriptures “because they are our principal source for the 
life and teaching of the Incarnate Word, our Savior.”^ ( 515 ) 

126 We can distinguish three stages in the formation of the Gospels: (Z6) 

1. The life and teaching of Jesus. The Church holds firmly that the four Gospels, “whose 
historicity she unhesitatingly affirms, faithfully hand on what Jesus, the Son of God, while he 
lived among men, really did and taught for their eternal salvation, until the day when he was 
taken up. ”23 

2. The oral tradition. “For, after the ascension of the Lord, the apostles handed on to their 








hearers what he had said and done, but with that fuller understanding which they, instructed 
by the glorious events of Christ and enlightened by the Spirit of truth, now enjoyed.”!^ 

3. The written Gospels. “The sacred authors, in writing the four Gospels, selected certain of the 
many elements which had been handed on, either orally or already in written form; others 
they synthesized or explained with an eye to the situation of the churches, while sustaining the 
form of preaching, but always in such a fashion that they have told us the honest truth about 
Jesus. ”101 

127 The fourfold Gospel holds a unique place in the Church, as is evident both in the veneration 
which the liturgy accords it and in the surpassing attraction it has exercised on the saints at all 
times: &lt; 1154 . 2705) 

There is no doctrine which could be better, more precious and more splendid than the text of 
the Gospel. Behold and retain what our Lord and Master, Christ, has taught by his words and 
accomplished by his deeds.1^2 

But above all it’s the Gospels that occupy my mind when I’m at prayer; my poor soul has so 
many needs, and yet this is the one thing needful. I’m always finding fresh lights there, hidden 
and enthralling meanings.!^ 

The unity of the Old and New Testaments 

128 The Church, as early as apostolic times, 124 and then constantly in her Tradition, has 
illuminated the unity of the divine plan in the two Testaments through typology, which discerns in 
God’s works of the Old Covenant prefigurations of what he accomplished in the fullness of time in 
the person of his incarnate Son. ( 1094 . 489) 

129 Christians therefore read the Old Testament in the light of Christ crucified and risen. Such 
typological reading discloses the inexhaustible content of the Old Testament; but it must not make 
us forget that the Old Testament retains its own intrinsic value as Revelation reaffirmed by our 
Lord himself. '-25 Besides, the New Testament has to be read in the light of the Old. Early Christian 
catechesis made constant use of the Old Testament. 122 As an old saying put it, the New Testament 
lies hidden in the Old and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New. 122 (681, 2055 . 1968 1 

130 Typology indicates the dynamic movement toward the fulfillment of the divine plan when 
“God [will] be everything to everyone. ”122 Nor do the calling of the patriarchs and the exodus from 
Egypt, for example, lose their own value in God’s plan, from the mere fact that they were 









intermediate stages. 


V. Sacred Scripture in the Life of the Church 

131 “And such is the force and power of the Word of God that it can serve the Church as her 
support and vigor and the children of the Church as strength for their faith, food for the soul, and a 
pure and lasting font of spiritual life. ”122 Hence “access to Sacred Scripture ought to be open wide 
to the Christian faithful. ”HQ 

132 “Therefore, the ‘study of the sacred page’ should be the very soul of sacred theology. The 
ministry of the Word, too—pastoral preaching, catechetics, and all forms of Christian instruction, 
among which the liturgical homily should hold pride of place—is healthily nourished and thrives in 
holiness through the Word of Scripture. ”Hi (94) 

133 The Church “forcefully and specifically exhorts all the Christian faithful... to learn The 
surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ,’ by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures. ‘Ignorance of 
the Scriptures is ignorance of Christ. ”’H2 (2653, 1792 1 


IN BRIEF 

134 All Sacred Scripture is but one book, and this one book is Christ, “because all divine Scripture 
speaks of Christ, and all divine Scripture is fulfilled in Christ” (Hugh of St. Victor, De area Noe 2, 
8: PL 176, 642: cf. ibid. 2, 9: PL 176, 642-643). 

135 “The Sacred Scriptures contain the Word of God and, because they are inspired they are truly 
the Word of God” (DV 24). 

136 God is the author of Sacred Scripture because he inspired its human authors; he acts in them 
and by means of them. He thus gives assurance that their writings teach without error his saving 
truth (cf. DV 11). 

137 Interpretation of the inspired Scripture must be attentive above all to what God wants to reveal 
through the sacred authors for our salvation. What comes from the Spirit is not fully “understood 
except by the Spirit’s action” (cf. Origen, Horn, in Ex. 4, 5: PG 12, 320). 

138 The Church accepts and venerates as inspired the 46 books of the Old Testament and the 27 







books of the New. 


139 The four Gospels occupy a central place because Christ Jesus is their center. 

140 The unity of the two Testaments proceeds from the unity of God’s plan and his Revelation. The 
Old Testament prepares for the New and the New Testament fulfills the Old; the two shed light on 
each other; both are true Word of God. 

141 “The Church has always venerated the divine Scriptures as she venerated the Body of the 
Lord” (DV 21): both nourish and govern the whole Christian life. “Your word is a lamp to my feet 
and a light to my path” (Ps 119:105; cf. Isa 50:4).

CHAPTER THREE 
MAN’S RESPONSE TO GOD 


142 By his Revelation, “the invisible God, from the fullness of his love, addresses men as his 
friends, and moves among them, in order to invite and receive them into his own company.”! The 
adequate response to this invitation is faith. 111021 

143 By faith, man completely submits his intellect and his will to God.? With his whole being man 
gives his assent to God the revealer. Sacred Scripture calls this human response to God, the author 
of revelation, “the obedience of faith.”2 (2087) 

ARTICLE 1 

I BELIEVE 


I. The Obedience of Faith 

144 To obey (from the Latin ob-audire, to “hear or listen to”) in faith is to submit freely to the 
word that has been heard, because its truth is guaranteed by God, who is Truth itself. Abraham is 
the model of such obedience offered us by Sacred Scripture. The Virgin Mary is its most perfect 
embodiment. 

Abraham — “father of all who believe” 

145 The Letter to the Hebrews, in its great eulogy of the faith of Israel’s ancestors, lays special 
emphasis on Abraham’s faith: “By faith, Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place 
which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was to go. ”4 By 
faith, he lived as a stranger and pilgrim in the promised land.^ By faith, Sarah was given to 
conceive the son of the promise. And by faith Abraham offered his only son in sacrifice.^ (59, 
2570 . 489 1 

146 Abraham thus fulfills the definition of faith in Hebrews 11:1: “Faith is the assurance of things 
hoped for, the conviction of things not seen”:? “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him 
as righteousness.Because he was “strong in his faith,” Abraham became the “father of all who 
believe. ( 1819 1 


147 The Old Testament is rich in witnesses to this faith. The Letter to the Hebrews proclaims its 










eulogy of the exemplary faith of the ancestors who “received divine approval. ”12 Yet “God had 
foreseen something better for us”: the grace of believing in his Son Jesus, “the pioneer and 
perfecter of our faith.”H ( 839 ) 

Mary — “Blessed is she who believed” 

148 The Virgin Mary most perfectly embodies the obedience of faith. By faith Mary welcomes the 
tidings and promise brought by the angel Gabriel, believing that “with God nothing will be 
impossible” and so giving her assent: “Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be [done] to me 
according to your word.”H Elizabeth greeted her: “Blessed is she who believed that there would be 
a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”12 It is for this faith that all generations 
have called Mary blessed.il (494, 2617 . 506) 

149 Throughout her life and until her last ordeal^ when Jesus her son died on the cross, Mary’s 
faith never wavered. She never ceased to believe in the fulfillment of God’s word. And so the 
Church venerates in Mary the purest realization of faith. (969, 507 . 829) 

II. “I Know Whom I Have Believed”^ 

To believe in God alone 

150 Faith is first of all a personal adherence of man to God. At the same time, and inseparably, it is 
a free assent to the whole truth that God has revealed. As personal adherence to God and assent to 
his truth, Christian faith differs from our faith in any human person. It is right and just to entrust 
oneself wholly to God and to believe absolutely what he says. It would be futile and false to place 
such faith in a creature.il ( 222 ) 

To believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God 

151 For a Christian, believing in God cannot be separated from believing in the One he sent, his 
“beloved Son,” in whom the Father is “well pleased”; God tells us to listen to him.12 The Lord 
himself said to his disciples: “Believe in God, believe also in me. ”12 We can believe in Jesus Christ 
because he is himself God, the Word made flesh: “No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is 
in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.”22 Because he “has seen the Father,” Jesus 
Christ is the only one who knows him and can reveal him.H ( 424 ) 


To believe in the Holy Spirit 











152 One cannot believe in Jesus Christ without sharing in his Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit who 
reveals to men who Jesus is. For “no one can say 'Jesus is Lord,’ except by the Holy Spirit, ”22 who 
“searches everything, even the depths of God.... No one comprehends the thoughts of God, except 
the Spirit of God.”23 Only God knows God completely: we believe in the Holy Spirit because he is 
God. (243, 683, 232) 

The Church never ceases to proclaim her faith in one only God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 

III. The Characteristics of Faith 

Faith is a grace 

153 When St. Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, Jesus declared to 
him that this revelation did not come “from flesh and blood,” but from “my Father who is in 
heaven.”24 Faith is a gift of God, a supernatural virtue infused by him. “Before this faith can be 
exercised, man must have the grace of God to move and assist him; he must have the interior helps 
of the Holy Spirit, who moves the heart and converts it to God, who opens the eyes of the mind and 
'makes it easy for all to accept and believe the truth. ’”25 (552, 1814 . 1996 . 2606 1 

Faith is a human act 

154 Believing is possible only by grace and the interior helps of the Holy Spirit. But it is no less 
true that believing is an authentically human act. Trusting in God and cleaving to the truths he has 
revealed are contrary neither to human freedom nor to human reason. Even in human relations it is 
not contrary to our dignity to believe what other persons tell us about themselves and their 
intentions or to trust their promises (for example, when a man and a woman marry) to share a 
communion of life with one another. If this is so, still less is it contrary to our dignity to “yield by 
faith the full submission of... intellect and will to God who reveals, ”25 and to share in an interior 
communion with him. ( 1749 . 2126 1 

155 In faith, the human intellect and will cooperate with divine grace: “Believing is an act of the 
intellect assenting to the divine truth by command of the will moved by God through grace. ”27 
(2008) 

Faith and understanding 


156 What moves us to believe is not the fact that revealed truths appear as true and intelligible in 












the light of our natural reason: we believe “because of the authority of God himself who reveals 
them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived.”^ So “that the submission of our faith might 
nevertheless be in accordance with reason, God willed that external proofs of his Revelation should 
be joined to the internal helps of the Holy Spirit.”^ Thus the miracles of Christ and the saints, 
prophecies, the Church’s growth and holiness, and her fruitfulness and stability “are the most 
certain signs of divine Revelation, adapted to the intelligence of all”; they are “motives of 
credibility” (motiva credibilitatis ), which show that the assent of faith is “by no means a blind 
impulse of the mind.”2Q ( 1063 . 2465 . 548 . 812 1 

157 Faith is certain. It is more certain than all human knowledge because it is founded on the very 
word of God who cannot lie. To be sure, revealed truths can seem obscure to human reason and 
experience, but “the certainty that the divine light gives is greater than that which the light of 
natural reason gives.”2I“Ten thousand difficulties do not make one doubt.”22 ( 2088 1 

158 “Faith seeks understanding”:^ it is intrinsic to faith that a believer desires to know better the 
One in whom he has put his faith and to understand better what He has revealed; a more penetrating 
knowledge will in turn call forth a greater faith, increasingly set afire by love. The grace of faith 
opens “the eyes of your hearts”^ to a lively understanding of the contents of Revelation: that is, of 
the totality of God’s plan and the mysteries of faith, of their connection with each other and with 
Christ, the center of the revealed mystery. “The same Holy Spirit constantly perfects faith by his 
gifts, so that Revelation may be more and more profoundly understood.”^ In the words of St. 
Augustine, “I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the better to believe. ”22 ( 2705 . 
1827 . 90, 2518 1 

159 Faith and science: “Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy 
between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has 
bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever 
contradict truth. ”2Z “Consequently, methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is 
carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with 
the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The 
humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of 
God in spite of himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are. 
( 283 . 2293 1 


The freedom of faith 












160 To be human, “man’s response to God by faith must be free, and... therefore nobody is to be 
forced to embrace the faith against his will. The act of faith is of its very nature a free act.”44 “God 
calls men to serve him in spirit and in truth. Consequently they are bound to him in conscience, but 
not coerced.... This fact received its fullest manifestation in Christ Jesus.”4Q Indeed, Christ invited 
people to faith and conversion, but never coerced them. “For he bore witness to the truth but 
refused to use force to impose it on those who spoke against it. His kingdom... grows by the love 
with which Christ, lifted up on the cross, draws men to himself. ”41 (1738 . 2106 . 616 1 

The necessity of faith 

161 Believing in Jesus Christ and in the One who sent him for our salvation is necessary for 
obtaining that salvation.42 “Since ‘without faith it is impossible to please [God]’ and to attain to the 
fellowship of his sons, therefore without faith no one has ever attained justification, nor will anyone 
obtain eternal life ‘but he who endures to the end. ’”44 ( 432 . 1257 . 846 ] 

Perseverance in faith 

162 Faith is an entirely free gift that God makes to man. We can lose this priceless gift, as St. Paul 
indicated to St. Timothy: “Wage the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience. By 
rejecting conscience, certain persons have made shipwreck of their faith.”44 To live, grow, and 
persevere in the faith until the end we must nourish it with the word of God; we must beg the Lord 
to increase our faith;45 it must be “working through charity,” abounding in hope, and rooted in the 
faith of the Church.46 ( 2089 . 1037 . 2016 . 2573 . 2849 1 

Faith—the beginning of eternal life 

163 Faith makes us taste in advance the light of the beatific vision, the goal of our journey here 
below. Then we shall see God “face to face,” “as he is.”4Z So faith is already the beginning of 
eternal life: ( 1088 1 

When we contemplate the blessings of faith even now, as if gazing at a reflection in a mirror, 
it is as if we already possessed the wonderful things which our faith assures us we shall one 
day enjoy. 44 

164 Now, however, “we walk by faith, not by sight”;44 we perceive God as “in a mirror, dimly” 
and only “in part. ”44 Even though enlightened by him in whom it believes, faith is often lived in 
darkness and can be put to the test. The world we live in often seems very far from the one 














promised us by faith. Our experiences of evil and suffering, injustice, and death, seem to contradict 
the Good News; they can shake our faith and become a temptation against it. 1 2846 . 309 . 1502 . 
1006 1 


165 It is then we must turn to the witnesses of faith: to Abraham, who “in hope... believed against 
hope”;^i to the Virgin Mary, who, in “her pilgrimage of faith,” walked into the “night of faith”^ in 
sharing the darkness of her son’s suffering and death; and to so many others: “Therefore, since we 
are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which 
clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the 
pioneer and perfecter of our faith.”^ 1 2719 1 

ARTICLE 2 

WE BELIEVE 


166 Faith is a personal act—the free response of the human person to the initiative of God who 
reveals himself. But faith is not an isolated act. No one can believe alone, just as no one can live 
alone. You have not given yourself faith as you have not given yourself life. The believer has 
received faith from others and should hand it on to others. Our love for Jesus and for our neighbor 
impels us to speak to others about our faith. Each believer is thus a link in the great chain of 
believers. I cannot believe without being carried by the faith of others, and by my faith I help 
support others in the faith. 1 875 1 

167 “I believe” (Apostles’ Creed ) is the faith of the Church professed personally by each believer, 
principally during Baptism. “We believe” (Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed ) is the faith of the 
Church confessed by the bishops assembled in council or more generally by the liturgical assembly 
of believers. “I believe” is also the Church, our mother, responding to God by faith as she teaches 
us to say both “I believe” and “We believe.” 1 1124 . 2040 1 

I. “Lord, Look upon the Faith of Your Church” 

168 It is the Church that believes first, and so bears, nourishes, and sustains my faith. Everywhere, 
it is the Church that first confesses the Lord: “Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims 
you.” as we sing in the hymn “Te Deum”; with her and in her, we are won over and brought to 
confess: “I believe,” “We believe.” It is through the Church that we receive faith and new life in 
Christ by Baptism. In the Rituale Romanum, the minister of Baptism asks the catechumen: “What 
do you ask of God’s Church?” And the answer is: “Faith.” “What does faith offer you?” “Eternal 












life ”54 (1253) 


169 Salvation comes from God alone; but because we receive the life of faith through the Church, 
she is our mother: “We believe the Church as the mother of our new birth, and not in the Church as 
if she were the author of our salvation.”^ Because she is our mother, she is also our teacher in the 
faith. (750, 2030 1 

II. The Language of Faith 

170 We do not believe in formulas, but in those realities they express, which faith allows us to 
touch. “The believer’s act [of faith] does not terminate in the propositions, but in the realities 
[which they express]. All the same, we do approach these realities with the help of formulations 
of the faith which permit us to express the faith and to hand it on, to celebrate it in community, to 
assimilate and live on it more and more. ( 186 ) 

171 The Church, “the pillar and bulwark of the truth,” faithfully guards “the faith which was once 
for all delivered to the saints.” She guards the memory of Christ’s words; it is she who from 
generation to generation hands on the apostles’ confession of faith.^Z As a mother who teaches her 
children to speak and so to understand and communicate, the Church our Mother teaches us the 
language of faith in order to introduce us to the understanding and the life of faith. (78, 857, 84, 
185) 

III. Only One Faith 

172 Through the centuries, in so many languages, cultures, peoples, and nations, the Church has 
constantly confessed this one faith, received from the one Lord, transmitted by one Baptism, and 
grounded in the conviction that all people have only one God and Father.53 St. Irenaeus of Lyons, a 
witness of this faith, declared: (813) 

173 “Indeed, the Church, though scattered throughout the whole world, even to the ends of the 
earth, having received the faith from the apostles and their disciples... guards [this preaching and 
faith] with care, as dwelling in but a single house, and similarly believes as if having but one soul 
and a single heart, and preaches, teaches, and hands on this faith with a unanimous voice, as if 
possessing only one mouth.”59 (830) 

174 “For though languages differ throughout the world, the content of the Tradition is one and the 
same. The Churches established in Germany have no other faith or Tradition, nor do those of the 










Iberians, nor those of the Celts, nor those of the East, of Egypt, of Libya, nor those established at 
the center of the world..The Church’s message “is true and solid, in which one and the same 
way of salvation appears throughout the whole world. (78) 

175 “We guard with care the faith that we have received from the Church, for without ceasing, 
under the action of God’s Spirit, this deposit of great price, as if in an excellent vessel, is constantly 
being renewed and causes the very vessel that contains it to be renewed.”^ 


IN BRIEF 

176 Faith is a personal adherence of the whole man to God who reveals himself. It involves an 
assent of the intellect and will to the self-revelation God has made through his deeds and words. 

177 “To believe” has thus a twofold reference: to the person and to the truth: to the truth, by trust in 
the person who bears witness to it. 

178 We must believe in no one but God: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 

179 Faith is a supernatural gift from God. In order to believe, man needs the interior helps of the 
Holy Spirit. 

180 “Believing” is a human act, conscious and free, corresponding to the dignity of the human 
person. 

181 “Believing” is an ecclesial act. The Church’s faith precedes, engenders, supports, and nourishes 
our faith. The Church is the mother of all believers. “No one can have God as Father who does not 
have the Church as Mother” (St. Cyprian, De unit. 6: PL 4, 519). 

182 We believe all “that which is contained in the word of God, written or handed down, and which 
the Church proposes for belief as divinely revealed” (Paul VI, CPG, § 20). 

183 Faith is necessary for salvation. The Lord himself affirms: “He who believes and is baptized 
will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned” (Mk 16:16). 

184 “Faith is a foretaste of the knowledge that will make us blessed in the life to come” (St. 
Thomas Aquinas, Comp, theol. 1, 2).

SECTION TWO: 

THE PROFESSION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH 


THE CREEDS 

185 Whoever says “I believe” says “I pledge myself to what we believe.” Communion in faith 
needs a common language of faith, normative for all and uniting all in the same confession of faith. 
( 171 . 949 1 

186 From the beginning, the apostolic Church expressed and handed on her faith in brief formulae 
for all.i But already early on, the Church also wanted to gather the essential elements of its faith 
into organic and articulated summaries, intended especially for candidates for Baptism: 

This synthesis of faith was not made to accord with human opinions, but rather what was of 
the greatest importance was gathered from all the Scriptures, to present the one teaching of the 
faith in its entirety. And just as the mustard seed contains a great number of branches in a tiny 
grain, so too this summary of faith encompassed in a few words the whole knowledge of the 
true religion contained in the Old and New Testaments. 2 

187 Such syntheses are called “professions of faith” since they summarize the faith that Christians 
profess. They are called “creeds” on account of what is usually their first word in Latin: credo (“I 
believe”). They are also called “symbols of faith.” 

188 The Greek word symbolon meant half of a broken object, for example, a seal presented as a 
token of recognition. The broken parts were placed together to verify the bearer’s identity. The 
symbol of faith, then, is a sign of recognition and communion between believers. Symbolon also 
means a gathering, collection, or summary. A symbol of faith is a summary of the principal truths 
of the faith and therefore serves as the first and fundamental point of reference for catechesis. 

189 The first “profession of faith” is made during Baptism. The symbol of faith is first and 
foremost the baptismal creed. Since Baptism is given “in the name of the Father and of the Son and 
of the Holy Spirit, ”3 the truths of faith professed during Baptism are articulated in terms of their 
reference to the three persons of the Holy Trinity. ( 1237 . 232 1 


190 And so the Creed is divided into three parts: “the first part speaks of the first divine Person and 






the wonderful work of creation; the next speaks of the second divine Person and the mystery of his 
redemption of men; the final part speaks of the third divine Person, the origin and source of our 
sanctification.”^ These are “the three chapters of our [baptismal] seal.”^ 

191 “These three parts are distinct although connected with one another. According to a 
comparison often used by the Fathers, we call them articles. Indeed, just as in our bodily members 
there are certain articulations which distinguish and separate them, so too in this profession of faith, 
the name articles has justly and rightly been given to the truths we must believe particularly and 
distinctly.”^ In accordance with an ancient tradition, already attested to by St. Ambrose, it is also 
customary to reckon the articles of the Creed as twelve, thus symbolizing the fullness of the 
apostolic faith by the number of the apostles.- 

192 Through the centuries many professions or symbols of faith have been articulated in response 
to the needs of the different eras: the creeds of the different apostolic and ancient Churches, ^ e.g., 
the Quicumque, also called the Athanasian Creed;^ the professions of faith of certain Councils, 
such as Toledo, Lateran, Lyons, Trent; or the symbols of certain popes, e.g., the Fides Damasi U 
or the Credo of the People of God of Paul VI.12 

193 None of the creeds from the different stages in the Church’s life can be considered superseded 
or irrelevant. They help us today to attain and deepen the faith of all times by means of the different 
summaries made of it. 

Among all the creeds, two occupy a special place in the Church’s life: 

194 The Apostles ’ Creed is so called because it is rightly considered to be a faithful summary of the 
apostles’ faith. It is the ancient baptismal symbol of the Church of Rome. Its great authority arises 
from this fact: it is “the Creed of the Roman Church, the See of Peter, the first of the apostles, to 
which he brought the common faith.”!^ 

195 The Niceno-Constantinopolitan or Nicene Creed draws its great authority from the fact that it 
stems from the first two ecumenical Councils (in 325 and 381). It remains common to all the great 
Churches of both East and West to this day. (242, 245, 465 1 

196 Our presentation of the faith will follow the Apostles’ Creed, which constitutes, as it were, “the 
oldest Roman catechism.” The presentation will be completed however by constant references to 
the Nicene Creed which is often more explicit and more detailed. 


197 As on the day of our Baptism, when our whole life was entrusted to the “standard of 





teaching,let us embrace the Creed of our life-giving faith. To say the Credo with faith is to enter 
into communion with God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and also with the whole Church which 
transmits the faith to us and in whose midst we believe: ( 1064 . 1274 ) 


This Creed is the spiritual seal, our hearts’ meditation and an ever-present guardian; it is, 
unquestionably, the treasure of our soul. 12

CHAPTER ONE 

I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER 


198 Our profession of faith begins with God, for God is the First and the Last,! the beginning and 
the end of everything. The Credo begins with God the Father, for the Father is the first divine 
person of the Most Holy Trinity; our Creed begins with the creation of heaven and earth, for 
creation is the beginning and the foundation of all God’s works. 

ARTICLE 1 

“I BELIEVE IN GOD THE FATHER ALMIGHTY, CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND 
EARTH” 


Paragraph 1.1 Believe in God 

199 “I believe in God”: this first affirmation of the Apostles’ Creed is also the most fundamental. 
The whole Creed speaks of God, and when it also speaks of man and of the world it does so in 
relation to God. The other articles of the Creed all depend on the first, just as the remaining 
Commandments make the first explicit. The other articles help us to know God better as he 
revealed himself progressively to men. “The faithful first profess their belief in God.”! (2083) 

I. “I Believe in One God” 


200 These are the words with which the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed begins. The confession 
of God’s oneness, which has its roots in the divine revelation of the Old Covenant, is inseparable 
from the profession of God’s existence and is equally fundamental. God is unique; there is only one 
God: “The Christian faith confesses that God is one in nature, substance, and essence.”! ( 2085 ) 

201 To Israel, his chosen, God revealed himself as the only One: “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our 
God is one LORD; and you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your 
soul, and with all your might.”! Through the prophets, God calls Israel and all nations to turn to 
him, the one and only God: “Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am God, and 
there is no other.... To me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. ‘Only in the LORD, it 
shall be said of me, are righteousness and strength.’”! ( 2083 ) 


202 Jesus himself affirms that God is “the one Lord” whom you must love “with all your heart, and 







with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.”^ At the same time Jesus 
gives us to understand that he himself is “the Lord.”Z To confess that Jesus is Lord is distinctive of 
Christian faith. This is not contrary to belief in the One God. Nor does believing in the Holy Spirit 
as “Lord and giver of life” introduce any division into the One God: (446, 152, 42) 

We firmly believe and confess without reservation that there is only one true God, eternal, 
infinite ( immensus ) and unchangeable, incomprehensible, almighty, and ineffable, the Father 
and the Son and the Holy Spirit; three persons indeed, but one essence, substance or nature 
entirely simple.^ 

II. God Reveals His Name 


203 God revealed himself to his people Israel by making his name known to them. A name 
expresses a person’s essence and identity and the meaning of this person’s life. God has a name; he 
is not an anonymous force. To disclose one’s name is to make oneself known to others; in a way it 
is to hand oneself over by becoming accessible, capable of being known more intimately and 
addressed personally. 12143 1 

204 God revealed himself progressively and under different names to his people, but the revelation 
that proved to be the fundamental one for both the Old and the New Covenants was the revelation 
of the divine name to Moses in the theophany of the burning bush, on the threshold of the Exodus 
and of the covenant on Sinai. (63) 

The living God 

205 God calls Moses from the midst of a bush that burns without being consumed: “I am the God 
of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.God is the God of 
the fathers, the One who had called and guided the patriarchs in their wanderings. He is the faithful 
and compassionate God who remembers them and his promises; he comes to free their descendants 
from slavery. He is the God who, from beyond space and time, can do this and wills to do it, the 
God who will put his almighty power to work for this plan. (2575, 268 1 

“I Am who I Am ” 

Moses said to God, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your 
fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?” 
God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel, ‘I Am 







has sent me to you’... this is my name for ever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all 
generations.”^ 

206 In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH (“I AM HE WHO IS,” “I AM WHO AM” or “I AM 
WHO I AM”), God says who he is and by what name he is to be called. This divine name is 
mysterious just as God is mystery. It is at once a name revealed and something like the refusal of a 
name, and hence it better expresses God as what he is—infinitely above everything that we can 
understand or say: he is the “hidden God,” his name is ineffable, and he is the God who makes 
himself close to men.U (43) 

207 By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his faithfulness which is from everlasting 
to everlasting, valid for the past (“I am the God of your fathers”),as for the future (“I will be with 
you”)!! God, who reveals his name as “I AM,” reveals himself as the God who is always there, 
present to his people in order to save them. 

208 Faced with God’s fascinating and mysterious presence, man discovers his own insignificance. 
Before the burning bush, Moses takes off his sandals and veils his face in the presence of God’s 
holiness.!! Before the glory of the thrice-holy God, Isaiah cries out: “Woe is me! I am lost; for I am 
a man of unclean lips. ”14 Before the divine signs wrought by Jesus, Peter exclaims: “Depart from 
me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.”!! But because God is holy, he can forgive the man who 
realizes that he is a sinner before him: “I will not execute my fierce anger... for I am God and not 
man, the Holy One in your midst.”!! The apostle John says likewise: “We shall... reassure our 
hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he 
knows everything.”!! ( 724 . 448 . 388) 

209 Out of respect for the holiness of God, the people of Israel do not pronounce his name. In the 
reading of Sacred Scripture, the revealed name (YHWH) is replaced by the divine title “LORD” (in 
Hebrew Adonai, in Greek Kyrios). It is under this title that the divinity of Jesus will be acclaimed: 
“Jesus is LORD.” (446) 

“A God merciful and gracious ” 

210 After Israel’s sin, when the people had turned away from God to worship the golden calf, God 
hears Moses’ prayer of intercession and agrees to walk in the midst of an unfaithful people, thus 
demonstrating his love.l! When Moses asks to see his glory, God responds “I will make all my 
goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you my name The LORD’ [YHWH]. ”12 Then 
the Lord passes before Moses and proclaims, “YHWH, YHWH, a God merciful and gracious, slow 






to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness”; Moses then confesses that the LORD is 
a forgiving God.^2 ( 2116 . 2577) 


211 The divine name, “I Am” or “He Is,” expresses God’s faithfulness: despite the faithlessness of 
men’s sin and the punishment it deserves, he keeps “steadfast love for thousands.”^! By going so 
far as to give up his own Son for us, God reveals that he is “rich in mercy.”-= By giving his life to 
free us from sin, Jesus reveals that he himself bears the divine name: “When you have lifted up the 
Son of man, then you will realize that T Am.’”^ (604) 

God alone IS 

212 Over the centuries, Israel’s faith was able to manifest and deepen realization of the riches 
contained in the revelation of the divine name. God is unique; there are no other gods besides 
him.^4 He transcends the world and history. He made heaven and earth: “They will perish, but you 
endure; they will all wear out like a garment... but you are the same, and your years have no end.”— 
In God “there is no variation or shadow due to change.”^ God is “He who Is,” from everlasting to 
everlasting, and as such remains ever faithful to himself and to his promises. (42, 469 . 2086 1 

213 The revelation of the ineffable name “I Am who Am” contains then the truth that God alone IS. 
The Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, and following it the Church’s Tradition, 
understood the divine name in this sense: God is the fullness of Being and of every perfection, 
without origin and without end. All creatures receive all that they are and have from him; but he 
alone is his very being, and he is of himself everything that he is. (41) 

III. God, “He Who Is,” Is Truth and Love 


214 God, “He who is,” revealed himself to Israel as the one “abounding in steadfast love and 
faithfulness.”^ These two terms express summarily the riches of the divine name. In all his works 
God displays not only his kindness, goodness, grace, and steadfast love, but also his 
trustworthiness, constancy, faithfulness, and truth. “I give thanks to your name for your steadfast 
love and your faithfulness.”^ He is the Truth, for “God is light and in him there is no darkness”; 
“God is love,” as the apostle John teaches.^2 ( 1062 1 

God is truth 

215 “The sum of your word is truth; and every one of your righteous ordinances endures 
forever.”^ “And now, O LORD God, you are God, and your words are true;”21 this is why God’s 








promises always come true.22 God is Truth itself, whose words cannot deceive. This is why one 
can abandon oneself in full trust to the truth and faithfulness of his word in all things. The 
beginning of sin and of man’s fall was due to a lie of the tempter who induced doubt of God’s 
word, kindness, and faithfulness. (2465, 1063 . 156 . 397) 

216 God’s truth is his wisdom, which commands the whole created order and governs the world.22 
God, who alone made heaven and earth, can alone impart true knowledge of every created thing in 
relation to himself .24 ( 295 . 32) 

217 God is also truthful when he reveals himself—the teaching that comes from God is “true 
instruction.”^ When he sends his Son into the world it will be “to bear witness to the truth”;2h “We 
know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him who is true. ”27 
1 851 . 2466 1 

God is love 

218 In the course of its history, Israel was able to discover that God had only one reason to reveal 
himself to them, a single motive for choosing them from among all peoples as his special 
possession: his sheer gratuitous love.2£ And thanks to the prophets Israel understood that it was 
again out of love that God never stopped saving them and pardoning their unfaithfulness and sins.22 
(295) 

219 God’s love for Israel is compared to a father’s love for his son. His love for his people is 
stronger than a mother’s for her children. God loves his people more than a bridegroom his 
beloved; his love will be victorious over even the worst infidelities and will extend to his most 
precious gift: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son.”4Q (239, 796, 458 1 

220 God’s love is “everlasting”: 41 “For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my 
steadfast love shall not depart from you.”42 Through Jeremiah, God declares to his people, “I have 
loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you. ”42 

221 But St. John goes even further when he affirms that “God is love”;44 God’s very being is love. 
By sending his only Son and the Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his 
innermost secret;4S God himself is an eternal exchange of love, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and he 
has destined us to share in that exchange. ( 733 . 851 . 257 ) 


IV. The Implications of Faith in One God 
















222 Believing in God, the only One, and loving him with all our being has enormous consequences 
for our whole life. 

223 It means coming to know God’s greatness and majesty: “Behold, God is great, and we know 
him not.”4§ Therefore, we must “serve God first.”— ( 400 ) 

224 It means living in thanksgiving: if God is the only One, everything we are and have comes 
from him: “What have you that you did not receive?”^ “What shall I render to the Lord for all his 
bounty to me?”49 (2637) 

225 It means knowing the unity and true dignity of all men: Everyone is made in the image and 
likeness of God.^ (356, 360,1700, 1934 1 

226 It means making good use of created things: faith in God, the only One, leads us to use 
everything that is not God only insofar as it brings us closer to him, and to detach ourselves from it 
insofar as it turns us away from him: (339, 2402 . 2415 1 

My Lord and my God, take from me everything that distances me from you. My Lord and my 
God, give me everything that brings me closer to you. My Lord and my God, detach me from 
myself to give my all to you.-^i 

227 It means trusting God in every circumstance, even in adversity. A prayer of St. Teresa of Jesus 
wonderfully expresses this trust: (313, 2090 . 2830 . 1723 1 

Let nothing trouble you / Let nothing frighten you 

Everything passes / God never changes 

Patience / Obtains all 

Whoever has God / Wants for nothing 

God alone is enough.^ 


IN BRIEF 


228 “Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God is one LORD...” (Deut 6:4; Mk 12:29). “The supreme 
being must be unique, without equal.... If God is not one, he is not God” (Tertullian, Adv. Marc., 1, 
3, 5: PL 2, 274). 

















229 Faith in God leads us to turn to him alone as our first origin and our ultimate goal, and neither 
to prefer anything to him nor to substitute anything for him. 

230 Even when he reveals himself, God remains a mystery beyond words: “If you understood him, 
it would not be God” (St. Augustine, Sermo 52, 6, 16: PL 38:360 and Sermo 117, 3, 5: PL 38, 663). 

231 The God of our faith has revealed himself as He who is; and he has made himself known as 
“abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness” (Ex 34:6). God’s very being is Truth and Love. 


Paragraph 2. The Father 

I. "In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” 


232 Christians are baptized “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”^ 
Before receiving the sacrament, they respond to a three-part question when asked to confess the 
Father, the Son, and the Spirit: “I do.” “The faith of all Christians rests on the Trinity.”^ ( 189 . 
1223) 

233 Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: not in 
their names , ^ for there is only one God, the almighty Father, his only Son, and the Holy Spirit: the 
Most Holy Trinity. 

234 The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian faith and life. It is the 
mystery of God in himself. It is therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that 
enlightens them. It is the most fundamental and essential teaching in the “hierarchy of the truths of 
faith.The whole history of salvation is identical with the history of the way and the means by 
which the one true God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, reveals himself to men “and reconciles and 
unites with himself those who turn away from sin.”^Z ( 2157 . 90, 1449 1 

235 This paragraph expounds briefly (I) how the mystery of the Blessed Trinity was revealed, (II) 
how the Church has articulated the doctrine of the faith regarding this mystery, and (III) how, by 
the divine missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit, God the Father fulfills the “plan of his loving 
goodness” of creation, redemption, and sanctification. 

236 The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology ( theologia ) and economy ( oikonomia ). 
“Theology” refers to the mystery of God’s inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and “economy” to 








all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates his life. Through the oikonomia the 
theologia is revealed to us; but conversely, the theologia illuminates the whole oikonomia. God’s 
works reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of 
all his works. So it is, analogously, among human persons. A person discloses himself in his 
actions, and the better we know a person, the better we understand his actions. ( 1066 . 259) 

237 The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the “mysteries that are hidden in 
God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God.”^ To be sure, God has left traces 
of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the Old Testament. 
But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to 
Israel’s faith before the Incarnation of God’s Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit. (50) 

II. The Revelation of God as Trinity 


The Father revealed by the Son 

238 Many religions invoke God as “Father.” The deity is often considered the “father of gods and 
of men.” In Israel, God is called “Father” inasmuch as he is Creator of the world.^2 Even more, 
God is Father because of the covenant and the gift of the law to Israel, “his first-born son.”h2 God 
is also called the Father of the king of Israel. Most especially he is “the Father of the poor,” of the 
orphaned and the widowed, who are under his loving protection.^ ( 2443 1 

239 By calling God “Father,” the language of faith indicates two main things: that God is the first 
origin of everything and transcendent authority; and that he is at the same time goodness and loving 
care for all his children. God’s parental tenderness can also be expressed by the image of 
motherhood,^ which emphasizes God’s immanence, the intimacy between Creator and creature. 
The language of faith thus draws on the human experience of parents, who are in a way the first 
representatives of God for man. But this experience also tells us that human parents are fallible and 
can disfigure the face of fatherhood and motherhood. We ought therefore to recall that God 
transcends the human distinction between the sexes. He is neither man nor woman: he is God. He 
also transcends human fatherhood and motherhood, although he is their origin and standard:^ no 
one is father as God is Father. ( 370 . 2779 1 

240 Jesus revealed that God is Father in an unheard-of sense: he is Father not only in being Creator; 
he is eternally Father in relation to his only Son, who is eternally Son only in relation to his Father: 
“No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one 







to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”§4 ( 2780 . 441-445 1 


241 For this reason the apostles confess Jesus to be the Word: “In the beginning was the Word, and 
the Word was with God, and the Word was God”; as “the image of the invisible God”; as the 
“radiance of the glory of God and the very stamp of his nature.”^ 

242 Following this apostolic tradition, the Church confessed at the first ecumenical council at 
Nicaea (325) that the Son is “consubstantial” with the Father, that is, one only God with him.^ The 
second ecumenical council, held at Constantinople in 381, kept this expression in its formulation of 
the Nicene Creed and confessed “the only-begotten Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, 
light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father.”^ 
(465) 

The Father and the Son revealed by the Spirit 

243 Before his Passover, Jesus announced the sending of “another Paraclete” (Advocate), the Holy 
Spirit. At work since creation, having previously “spoken through the prophets,” the Spirit will now 
be with and in the disciples, to teach them and guide them “into all the truth.”^ The Holy Spirit is 
thus revealed as another divine person with Jesus and the Father. (683, 2780 . 687 ) 

244 The eternal origin of the Holy Spirit is revealed in his mission in time. The Spirit is sent to the 
apostles and to the Church both by the Father in the name of the Son, and by the Son in person, 
once he had returned to the Father.^ The sending of the person of the Spirit after Jesus’ 
glorification^ reveals in its fullness the mystery of the Holy Trinity. ( 732 ) 

245 The apostolic faith concerning the Spirit was confessed by the second ecumenical council at 
Constantinople (381): “We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from 
the Father.”^! By this confession, the Church recognizes the Father as “the source and origin of the 
whole divinity.”22 But the eternal origin of the Spirit is not unconnected with the Son’s origin: 
“The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is God, one and equal with the Father and the Son, 
of the same substance and also of the same nature.... Yet he is not called the Spirit of the Father 
alone,... but the Spirit of both the Father and the Son.”^3 The Creed of the Church from the Council 
of Constantinople confesses: “With the Father and the Son, he is worshipped and glorified.”^ ( 152 . 
685 ) 

246 The Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Spirit “proceeds from the Father and the Son 
( filioque ).” The Council of Florence in 1438 explains: “The Holy Spirit is eternally from Father and 











Son; He has his nature and subsistence at once ( simul ) from the Father and the Son. He proceeds 
eternally from both as from one principle and through one spiration.... And, since the Father has 
through generation given to the only-begotten Son everything that belongs to the Father, except 
being Father, the Son has also eternally from the Father, from whom he is eternally born, that the 
Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son. ”^2 

247 The affirmation of the filioque does not appear in the Creed confessed in 381 at 
Constantinople. But Pope St. Leo I, following an ancient Latin and Alexandrian tradition, had 
already confessed it dogmatically in 447,even before Rome, in 451 at the Council of Chalcedon, 
came to recognize and receive the Symbol of 381. The use of this formula in the Creed was 
gradually admitted into the Latin liturgy (between the eighth and eleventh centuries). The 
introduction of the filioque into the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the Latin liturgy 
constitutes moreover, even today, a point of disagreement with the Orthodox Churches. 

248 At the outset the Eastern tradition expresses the Father’s character as first origin of the Spirit. 
By confessing the Spirit as he “who proceeds from the Father,” it affirms that he comes from the 
Father through the Son.L^The Western tradition expresses first the consubstantial communion 
between Father and Son, by saying that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (filioque). 
It says this, “legitimately and with good reason,”^ for the eternal order of the divine persons in 
their consubstantial communion implies that the Father, as “the principle without principle,”^ is 
the first origin of the Spirit, but also that as Father of the only Son, he is, with the Son, the single 
principle from which the Holy Spirit proceeds.^ This legitimate complementarity, provided it does 
not become rigid, does not affect the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed. 

III. The Holy Trinity in the Teaching of the Faith 


The formation of the Trinitarian dogma 

249 From the beginning, the revealed truth of the Holy Trinity has been at the very root of the 
Church’s living faith, principally by means of Baptism. It finds its expression in the rule of 
baptismal faith, formulated in the preaching, catechesis, and prayer of the Church. Such 
formulations are already found in the apostolic writings, such as this salutation taken up in the 
Eucharistic liturgy: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of 
the Holy Spirit be with you all.”^i (683, 189 1 


250 During the first centuries the Church sought to clarify its Trinitarian faith, both to deepen its 




own understanding of the faith and to defend it against the errors that were deforming it. This 
clarification was the work of the early councils, aided by the theological work of the Church 
Fathers and sustained by the Christian people’s sense of the faith. (94) 

251 In order to articulate the dogma of the Trinity, the Church had to develop its own terminology 
with the help of certain notions of philosophical origin: “substance,” “person” or “hypostasis,” 
“relation,” and so on. In doing this, she did not submit the faith to human wisdom, but gave a new 
and unprecedented meaning to these terms, which from then on would be used to signify an 
ineffable mystery, “infinitely beyond all that we can humanly understand.”^ (170) 

252 The Church uses (I) the term “substance” (rendered also at times by “essence” or “nature”) to 
designate the divine being in its unity, (II) the term “person” or “hypostasis” to designate the 
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the real distinction among them, and (III) the term “relation” to 
designate the fact that their distinction lies in the relationship of each to the others. 

The dogma of the Holy Trinity 

253 The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the 
“consubstantial Trinity.”^ The divine persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but 
each of them is God whole and entire: “The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which the 
Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is, i.e., by nature one God.”^ In the 
words of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215): “Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the 
divine substance, essence or nature.”^ ( 2789 . 590) 

254 The divine persons are really distinct from one another. “God is one but not solitary.”^ 
“Father,” “Son,” “Holy Spirit” are not simply names designating modalities of the divine being, for 
they are really distinct from one another: “He is not the Father who is the Son, nor is the Son he 
who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the Father or the Son.”^ They are distinct from 
one another in their relations of origin: “It is the Father who generates, the Son who is begotten, 
and the Holy Spirit who proceeds.”^ The divine Unity is Triune. (468, 689 1 

255 The divine persons are relative to one another. Because it does not divide the divine unity, the 
real distinction of the persons from one another resides solely in the relationships which relate them 
to one another: “In the relational names of the persons the Father is related to the Son, the Son to 
the Father, and the Holy Spirit to both. While they are called three persons in view of their 
relations, we believe in one nature or substance.”^ Indeed “everything (in them) is one where there 
is no opposition of relationship.”^ “Because of that unity the Father is wholly in the Son and 







wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Son is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Holy Spirit; the Holy 
Spirit is wholly in the Father and wholly in the Son.”2i (240) 


256 St. Gregory of Nazianzus, also called “the Theologian,” entrusts this summary of Trinitarian 
faith to the catechumens of Constantinople: (236, 684, 84) 

Above all guard for me this great deposit of faith for which I live and fight, which I want to 
take with me as a companion, and which makes me bear all evils and despise all pleasures: I 
mean the profession of faith in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. I entrust it to you 
today. By it I am soon going to plunge you into water and raise you up from it. I give it to you 
as the companion and patron of your whole life. I give you but one divinity and power, 
existing one in three, and containing the three in a distinct way. Divinity without disparity of 
substance or nature, without superior degree that raises up or inferior degree that casts down... 
the infinite co-naturality of three infinites. Each person considered in himself is entirely God... 
the three considered together.... I have not even begun to think of unity when the Trinity 
bathes me in its splendor. I have not even begun to think of the Trinity when unity grasps 
me.... 22 

IV. The Divine Works and the Trinitarian Missions 


257 “O blessed light, O Trinity and first Unity!”23 God is eternal blessedness, undying life, 
unfading light. God is love: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God freely wills to communicate the 
glory of his blessed life. Such is the “plan of his loving kindness,” conceived by the Father before 
the foundation of the world, in his beloved Son: “He destined us in love to be his sons” and “to be 
conformed to the image of his Son,” through “the spirit of sonship.”24 This plan is a “grace [which] 
was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,” stemming immediately from Trinitarian 
love .22 It unfolds in the work of creation, the whole history of salvation after the fall, and the 
missions of the Son and the Spirit, which are continued in the mission of the Church.22 ( 221 . 758 . 
292 . 850) 

258 The whole divine economy is the common work of the three divine persons. For as the Trinity 
has only one and the same nature, so too does it have only one and the same operation: “The 
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one principle. ”2Z 
However each divine person performs the common work according to his unique personal property. 
Thus the Church confesses, following the New Testament, “one God and Father from whom all 
things are, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and one Holy Spirit in whom all 









things are. ”22 It is above all the divine missions of the Son’s Incarnation and the gift of the Holy 
Spirit that show forth the properties of the divine persons. (686) 


259 Being a work at once common and personal, the whole divine economy makes known both 
what is proper to the divine persons and their one divine nature. Hence the whole Christian life is a 
communion with each of the divine persons, without in any way separating them. Everyone who 
glorifies the Father does so through the Son in the Holy Spirit; everyone who follows Christ does 
so because the Father draws him and the Spirit moves him.22 ( 236 1 

260 The ultimate end of the whole divine economy is the entry of God’s creatures into the perfect 
unity of the Blessed Trinity.^ But even now we are called to be a dwelling for the Most Holy 
Trinity: “If a man loves me,” says the Ford, “he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, 
and we will come to him, and make our home with him”: 121 ( 1050 . 1721 . 1997 . 2565 1 

O my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me forget myself entirely so to establish myself in you, 
unmovable and peaceful as if my soul were already in eternity. May nothing be able to trouble 
my peace or make me leave you, O my unchanging God, but may each minute bring me more 
deeply into your mystery! Grant my soul peace. Make it your heaven, your beloved dwelling 
and the place of your rest. May I never abandon you there, but may I be there, whole and 
entire, completely vigilant in my faith, entirely adoring, and wholly given over to your 
creative action. -213 


IN BRIEF 


261 The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of the Christian faith and of 
Christian life. God alone can make it known to us by revealing himself as Father, Son, and Holy 
Spirit. 

262 The Incarnation of God’s Son reveals that God is the eternal Father and that the Son is 
consubstantial with the Father, which means that, in the Father and with the Father, the Son is one 
and the same God. 

263 The mission of the Holy Spirit, sent by the Father in the name of the Son (Jn 14:26) and by the 
Son “from the Father” (Jn 15:26), reveals that, with them, the Spirit is one and the same God. 
“With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified” (Nicene Creed). 










264 “The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father as the first principle and, by the eternal gift of this 
to the Son, from the communion of both the Father and the Son” (St. Augustine, De Trin. 15, 26, 
47: PL 42:1095). 

265 By the grace of Baptism “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” we 
are called to share in the life of the Blessed Trinity, here on earth in the obscurity of faith, and after 
death in eternal light (Cf. Paul VI, CPG § 9). 

266 “Now this is the Catholic faith: We worship one God in the Trinity and the Trinity in unity, 
without either confusing the persons or dividing the substance; for the person of the Father is one, 
the Son’s is another, the Holy Spirit’s another; but the Godhead of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit 
is one, their glory equal, their majesty coeternal” (Athanasian Creed; DS 75; ND 16). 

267 Inseparable in what they are, the divine persons are also inseparable in what they do. But 
within the single divine operation each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity, especially 
in the divine missions of the Son’s Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Paragraph 3. The Almighty 

268 Of all the divine attributes, only God’s omnipotence is named in the Creed: to confess this 
power has great bearing on our lives. We believe that his might is universal, for God who created 
everything also rules everything and can do everything. God’s power is loving, for he is our Father, 
and mysterious, for only faith can discern it when it “is made perfect in weakness. ”122 ( 222 ) 

“He does whatever he pleases” 121 

269 The Holy Scriptures repeatedly confess the universal power of God. He is called the “Mighty 
One of Jacob,” the “LORD of hosts,” the “strong and mighty” one. If God is almighty “in heaven 
and on earth,” it is because he made them.122 Nothing is impossible with God, who disposes his 
works according to his will.126 He is the Lord of the universe, whose order he established and 



which remains wholly subject to him and at his disposal. He is master of history, governing hearts 
and events in keeping with his will: “It is always in your power to show great strength, and who can 
withstand the strength of your arm?”df&gt;Z ( 303 ) 

“You are merciful to all, for you can do all things ”1^8 

270 God is the Father Almighty, whose fatherhood and power shed light on one another: God 
reveals his fatherly omnipotence by the way he takes care of our needs; by the filial adoption that 
he gives us (“I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord 
Almighty.”):^ finally by his infinite mercy, for he displays his power at its height by freely 
forgiving sins. (2777 . 1441) 

271 God’s almighty power is in no way arbitrary: “In God, power, essence, will, intellect, wisdom, 
and justice are all identical. Nothing therefore can be in God’s power which could not be in his just 
will or his wise intellect.”^ 

The mystery of God’s apparent powerlessness 

272 Faith in God the Father Almighty can be put to the test by the experience of evil and suffering. 
God can sometimes seem to be absent and incapable of stopping evil. But in the most mysterious 
way God the Father has revealed his almighty power in the voluntary humiliation and Resurrection 
of his Son, by which he conquered evil. Christ crucified is thus “the power of God and the wisdom 
of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than 
men.”Hi it is in Christ’s Resurrection and exaltation that the Father has shown forth “the 
immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe. ”H2 ( 309 . 412 . 609 . 648 ) 

273 Only faith can embrace the mysterious ways of God’s almighty power. This faith glories in its 
weaknesses in order to draw to itself Christ’s power. The Virgin Mary is the supreme model of 
this faith, for she believed that “nothing will be impossible with God,” and was able to magnify the 
Lord: “For he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.”H4 (148) 

274 “Nothing is more apt to confirm our faith and hope than holding it fixed in our minds that 
nothing is impossible with God. Once our reason has grasped the idea of God’s almighty power, it 
will easily and without any hesitation admit everything that [the Creed] will afterwards propose for 
us to believe—even if they be great and marvellous things, far above the ordinary laws of 
nature.”^ (1814, 1817 ] 















IN BRIEF 


275 With Job, the just man, we confess: “I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of 
yours can be thwarted” (Job 42:2). 

276 Faithful to the witness of Scripture, the Church often addresses its prayer to the “almighty and 
eternal God” (“omnipotens sempiterne Deus...”), believing firmly that “nothing will be impossible 
with God” (Gen 18:14; Lk 1:37; Mt 19:26). 

Til God shows forth his almighty power by converting us from our sins and restoring us to his 
friendship by grace. “God, you show your almighty power above all in your mercy and 
forgiveness...” (Roman Missal, 26th Sunday, Opening Prayer). 

278 If we do not believe that God’s love is almighty, how can we believe that the Father could 
create us, the Son redeem us, and the Holy Spirit sanctify us? 


Paragraph 4. The Creator 

279 “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”ii§ Holy Scripture begins with these 
solemn words. The profession of faith takes them up when it confesses that God the Father 
almighty is “Creator of heaven and earth” ( Apostles’ Creed), “of all that is, seen and unseen” 
(Nicene Creed). We shall speak first of the Creator, then of creation, and finally of the fall into sin 
from which Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to raise us up again. 

280 Creation is the foundation of “all God’s saving plans,” the “beginning of the history of 
salvation”?^ that culminates in Christ. Conversely, the mystery of Christ casts conclusive light on 
the mystery of creation and reveals the end for which “in the beginning God created the heavens 
and the earth”: from the beginning, God envisaged the glory of the new creation in Christ. ( 288 . 
1043 1 

281 And so the readings of the Easter Vigil, the celebration of the new creation in Christ, begin 
with the creation account; likewise in the Byzantine liturgy, the account of creation always 
constitutes the first reading at the vigils of the great feasts of the Lord. According to ancient 
witnesses the instruction of catechumens for Baptism followed the same itinerary.!^ ( 1095 ) 


I. Catechesis on Creation 








282 Catechesis on creation is of major importance. It concerns the very foundations of human and 
Christian life: for it makes explicit the response of the Christian faith to the basic question that men 
of all times have asked themselves:^ “Where do we come from?” “Where are we going?” “What 
is our origin?” “What is our end?” “Where does everything that exists come from and where is it 
going?” The two questions, the first about the origin and the second about the end, are inseparable. 
They are decisive for the meaning and orientation of our life and actions. ( 1730 1 

283 The question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific 
studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, 
the development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These discoveries invite us to even 
greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his 
works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers. With Solomon 
they can say: “It is he who gave me unerring knowledge of what exists, to know the structure of the 
world and the activity of the elements... for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me.”121 
( 159 . 341 1 

284 The great interest accorded to these studies is strongly stimulated by a question of another 
order, which goes beyond the proper domain of the natural sciences. It is not only a question of 
knowing when and how the universe arose physically, or when man appeared, but rather of 
discovering the meaning of such an origin: is the universe governed by chance, blind fate, 
anonymous necessity, or by a transcendent, intelligent and good Being called “God”? And if the 
world does come from God’s wisdom and goodness, why is there evil? Where does it come from? 
Who is responsible for it? Is there any liberation from it? 

285 Since the beginning the Christian faith has been challenged by responses to the question of 
origins that differ from its own. Ancient religions and cultures produced many myths concerning 
origins. Some philosophers have said that everything is God, that the world is God, or that the 
development of the world is the development of God (Pantheism). Others have said that the world 
is a necessary emanation arising from God and returning to him. Still others have affirmed the 
existence of two eternal principles, Good and Evil, Light and Darkness, locked in permanent 
conflict (Dualism, Manichaeism). According to some of these conceptions, the world (at least the 
physical world) is evil, the product of a fall, and is thus to be rejected or left behind (Gnosticism). 
Some admit that the world was made by God, but as by a watchmaker who, once he has made a 
watch, abandons it to itself (Deism). Finally, others reject any transcendent origin for the world, but 
see it as merely the interplay of matter that has always existed (Materialism). All these attempts 
bear witness to the permanence and universality of the question of origins. This inquiry is 





distinctively human. (295, 28) 


286 Human intelligence is surely already capable of finding a response to the question of origins. 
The existence of God the Creator can be known with certainty through his works, by the light of 
human reason, E12 even if this knowledge is often obscured and disfigured by error. This is why 
faith comes to confirm and enlighten reason in the correct understanding of this truth: “By faith we 
understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made out of 
things which do not appear.”^ (32, 37) 

287 The truth about creation is so important for all of human life that God in his tenderness wanted 
to reveal to his People everything that is salutary to know on the subject. Beyond the natural 
knowledge that every man can have of the Creator, EM God progressively revealed to Israel the 
mystery of creation. He who chose the patriarchs, who brought Israel out of Egypt, and who by 
choosing Israel created and formed it, this same God reveals himself as the One to whom belong all 
the peoples of the earth, and the whole earth itself; he is the One who alone “made heaven and 
earth. ’’EE 1 (107) 

288 Thus the revelation of creation is inseparable from the revelation and forging of the covenant 
of the one God with his People. Creation is revealed as the first step toward this covenant, the first 
and universal witness to God’s all-powerful love. EM And so, the truth of creation is also expressed 
with growing vigor in the message of the prophets, the prayer of the psalms and the liturgy, and in 
the wisdom sayings of the Chosen People.EG ( 280 . 2569 1 

289 Among all the Scriptural texts about creation, the first three chapters of Genesis occupy a 
unique place. From a literary standpoint these texts may have had diverse sources. The inspired 
authors have placed them at the beginning of Scripture to express in their solemn language the 
truths of creation—its origin and its end in God, its order and goodness, the vocation of man, and 
finally the drama of sin and the hope of salvation. Read in the light of Christ, within the unity of 
Sacred Scripture and in the living Tradition of the Church, these texts remain the principal source 
for catechesis on the mysteries of the “beginning”: creation, fall, and promise of salvation. (390, 
111 1 

II. Creation—Work of the Holy Trinity 


290 “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth”;EM three things are affirmed in these 
first words of Scripture: the eternal God gave a beginning to all that exists outside of himself; he 








alone is Creator (the verb “create” — Hebrew bar a —always has God for its subject). The totality 
of what exists (expressed by the formula “the heavens and the earth”) depends on the One who 
gives it being. (326) 

291 “In the beginning was the Word... and the Word was God... all things were made through him, 
and without him was not anything made that was made. ”122 The New Testament reveals that God 
created everything by the eternal Word, his beloved Son. In him “all things were created, in heaven 
and on earth... all things were created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him 
all things hold together. ”122 The Church’s faith likewise confesses the creative action of the Holy 
Spirit, the “giver of life,” “the Creator Spirit” (“ Veni, Creator Spiritus”), the “source of every 
g ood.”121 (241, 331, 703 1 

292 The Old Testament suggests and the New Covenant reveals the creative action of the Son and 
the Spirit,— inseparably one with that of the Father. This creative cooperation is clearly affirmed 
in the Church’s rule of faith: “There exists but one God... he is the Father, God, the Creator, the 
author, the giver of order. He made all things by himself, that is, by his Word and by his Wisdom,” 
“by the Son and the Spirit” who, so to speak, are “his hands. ”122 Creation is the common work of 
the Holy Trinity. (699, 257 1 

III. “The World Was Created for the Glory of God” 


293 Scripture and Tradition never cease to teach and celebrate this fundamental truth: “The world 
was made for the glory of God.”122 St. Bonaventure explains that God created all things “not to 
increase his glory, but to show it forth and to communicate it, ”122 for God has no other reason for 
creating than his love and goodness: “Creatures came into existence when the key of love opened 
his hand. ”122 The First Vatican Council explains: (337, 344 . 1361 . 759 1 

This one, true God, of his own goodness and “almighty power,” not for increasing his own 
beatitude, nor for attaining his perfection, but in order to manifest this perfection through the 
benefits which he bestows on creatures, with absolute freedom of counsel “and from the 
beginning of time, made out of nothing both orders of creatures, the spiritual and the 

corporeal.... ”1^7 

294 The glory of God consists in the realization of this manifestation and communication of his 
goodness, for which the world was created. God made us “to be his sons through Jesus Christ, 
according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace,” 122 for “the glory of God is 












man fully alive; moreover man’s life is the vision of God: if God’s revelation through creation has 
already obtained life for all the beings that dwell on earth, how much more will the Word’s 
manifestation of the Father obtain life for those who see God.”!^ The ultimate purpose of creation 
is that God “who is the creator of all things may at last become ‘all in all,’ thus simultaneously 
assuring his own glory and our beatitude. ”24Q ( 2809 . 1722 . 1992 ) 

IV. The Mystery of Creation 


God creates by wisdom and love 

295 We believe that God created the world according to his wisdom.^ it is not the product of any 
necessity whatever, nor of blind fate or chance. We believe that it proceeds from God’s free will; he 
wanted to make his creatures share in his being, wisdom, and goodness: “For you created all things, 
and by your will they existed and were created.”^ Therefore the Psalmist exclaims: “O LORD, 
how manifold are your works! In wisdom you have made them all”; and “The LORD is good to all, 
and his compassion is over all that he has made. ”143 ( 216 . 1951 1 

God creates “out of nothing” 

296 We believe that God needs no pre-existent thing or any help in order to create, nor is creation 
any sort of necessary emanation from the divine substance.^ God creates freely “out of 
nothing”: 145 (285) 


If God had drawn the world from pre-existent matter, what would be so extraordinary in that? 

A human artisan makes from a given material whatever he wants, while God shows his power 
by starting from nothing to make all he wants.— 

297 Scripture bears witness to faith in creation “out of nothing” as a truth full of promise and hope 
Thus the mother of seven sons encourages them for martyrdom: (338) 

I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who gave you life and 
breath, nor I who set in order the elements within each of you. Therefore the Creator of the 
world, who shaped the beginning of man and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy 
give life and breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake of his 
laws.... Look at the heaven and the earth and see everything that is in them, and recognize that 
God did not make them out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being.l^Z 









298 Since God could create everything out of nothing, he can also, through the Holy Spirit, give 
spiritual life to sinners by creating a pure heart in theml^S and bodily life to the dead through the 
Resurrection. God “gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. ”1^ 
And since God was able to make light shine in darkness by his Word, he can also give the light of 
faith to those who do not yet know him. 1^2 ( 1375 . 992) 

God creates an ordered and good world 

299 Because God creates through wisdom, his creation is ordered: “You have arranged all things by 
measure and number and weight.”!^! The universe, created in and by the eternal Word, the “image 
of the invisible God,” is destined for and addressed to man, himself created in the “image of God” 
and called to a personal relationship with God.1^2 Our human understanding, which shares in the 
light of the divine intellect, can understand what God tells us by means of his creation, though not 
without great effort and only in a spirit of humility and respect before the Creator and his work. 1^2 
Because creation comes forth from God’s goodness, it shares in that goodness — “And God saw 
that it was good... very good”^— for God willed creation as a gift addressed to man, an 
inheritance destined for and entrusted to him. On many occasions the Church has had to defend the 
goodness of creation, including that of the physical world.i^ (339, 41, 1147 . 358 . 2415 1 

God transcends creation and is present to it 

300 God is infinitely greater than all his works: “You have set your glory above the heavens. ”126 
Indeed, God’s “greatness is unsearchable. ”122 But because he is the free and sovereign Creator, the 
first cause of all that exists, God is present to his creatures’ inmost being: “In him we live and move 
and have our being. ”126 In the words of St. Augustine, God is “higher than my highest and more 
inward than my innermost self.”122 (42, 223) 

God upholds and sustains creation 

301 With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to themselves. He not only gives them being 
and existence, but also, and at every moment, upholds and sustains them in being, enables them to 
act and brings them to their final end. Recognizing this utter dependence with respect to the Creator 
is a source of wisdom and freedom, of joy and confidence: ( 1951 . 396 1 

For you love all things that exist, and detest none of the things that you have made; for you 
would not have made anything if you had hated it. How would anything have endured, if you 
had not willed it? Or how would anything not called forth by you have been preserved? You 











spare all things, for they are yours, O Lord, you who love the living.!^ 


V. God Carries out His Plan: Divine Providence 


302 Creation has its own goodness and proper perfection, but it did not spring forth complete from 
the hands of the Creator. The universe was created “in a state of journeying” (in statu viae) toward 
an ultimate perfection yet to be attained, to which God has destined it. We call “divine providence” 
the dispositions by which God guides his creation toward this perfection: 

By his providence God protects and governs all things which he has made, “reaching mightily 
from one end of the earth to the other, and ordering all things well.” For “all are open and laid 
bare to his eyes,” even those things which are yet to come into existence through the free 
action of creatures. 1^1 

303 The witness of Scripture is unanimous that the solicitude of divine providence is concrete and 
immediate; God cares for all, from the least things to the great events of the world and its history. 
The sacred books powerfully affirm God’s absolute sovereignty over the course of events: “Our 
God is in the heavens; he does whatever he pleases.”!^ And so it is with Christ, “who opens and 
no one shall shut, who shuts and no one opens. As the book of Proverbs states: “Many are the 
plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will be established.”!^ ( 269 ) 

304 And so we see the Holy Spirit, the principal author of Sacred Scripture, often attributing 
actions to God without mentioning any secondary causes. This is not a “primitive mode of speech,” 
but a profound way of recalling God’s primacy and absolute Lordship over history and the 
world,and so of educating his people to trust in him. The prayer of the Psalms is the great 
school of this trust.i^ (2568) 

305 Jesus asks for childlike abandonment to the providence of our heavenly Father who takes care 
of his children’s smallest needs: “Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?’ or 
'What shall we drink?.’... Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first his 
kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.”i§! 1 2115 1 

Providence and secondary causes 

306 God is the sovereign master of his plan. But to carry it out he also makes use of his creatures’ 
cooperation. This use is not a sign of weakness, but rather a token of almighty God’s greatness and 
goodness. For God grants his creatures not only their existence, but also the dignity of acting on 





their own, of being causes and principles for each other, and thus of cooperating in the 
accomplishment of his plan. ( 1884 . 1951 1 

307 To human beings God even gives the power of freely sharing in his providence by entrusting 
them with the responsibility of “subduing” the earth and having dominion over it.i^ God thus 
enables men to be intelligent and free causes in order to complete the work of creation, to perfect its 
harmony for their own good and that of their neighbors. Though often unconscious collaborators 
with God’s will, they can also enter deliberately into the divine plan by their actions, their prayers, 
and their sufferings.^ They then fully become “God’s fellow workers” and co-workers for his 
kingdom.!^ (106, 3Z3, 1954 . 2427 . 2738 . 618 . 1505 1 

308 The truth that God is at work in all the actions of his creatures is inseparable from faith in God 
the Creator. God is the first cause who operates in and through secondary causes: “For God is at 
work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. ”121 Far from diminishing the 
creature’s dignity, this truth enhances it. Drawn from nothingness by God’s power, wisdom, and 
goodness, it can do nothing if it is cut off from its origin, for “without a Creator the creature 
vanishes. ”122 still less can a creature attain its ultimate end without the help of God’s grace. 122 
(970) 

Providence and the scandal of evil 

309 If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and good world, cares for all his 
creatures, why does evil exist? To this question, as pressing as it is unavoidable and as painful as it 
is mysterious, no quick answer will suffice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the answer 
to this question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin, and the patient love of God who comes 
to meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his 
gathering of the Church, the power of the sacraments, and his call to a blessed life to which free 
creatures are invited to consent in advance, but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also 
turn away in advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is not in part an 
answer to the question of evil. ( 164 . 385 . 2850 1 

310 But why did God not create a world so perfect that no evil could exist in it? With infinite 
power God could always create something better.224 But with infinite wisdom and goodness God 
freely willed to create a world “in a state of journeying” toward its ultimate perfection. In God’s 
plan this process of becoming involves the appearance of certain beings and the disappearance of 
others, the existence of the more perfect alongside the less perfect, both constructive and 















destructive forces of nature. With physical good there exists also physical evil as long as creation 
has not reached perfection.!^ (412, 1042-1050 . 342) 


311 Angels and men, as intelligent and free creatures, have to journey toward their ultimate 
destinies by their free choice and preferential love. They can therefore go astray. Indeed, they have 
sinned. Thus has moral evil, incommensurably more harmful than physical evil, entered the world. 
God is in no way, directly or indirectly, the cause of moral evil.126 jq e permits it, however, because 
he respects the freedom of his creatures and, mysteriously, knows how to derive good from it: (396, 
1849 1 

For almighty God... , because he is supremely good, would never allow any evil whatsoever to 
exist in his works if he were not so all-powerful and good as to cause good to emerge from 
evil itself. 


312 In time we can discover that God in his almighty providence can bring a good from the 
consequences of an evil, even a moral evil, caused by his creatures: “It was not you,” said Joseph to 
his brothers, “who sent me here, but God.... You meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, 
to bring it about that many people should be kept alive. ”122 From the greatest moral evil ever 
committed—the rejection and murder of God’s only Son, caused by the sins of all men—God, by 
his grace that “abounded all the more, ”122 brought the greatest of goods: the glorification of Christ 
and our redemption. But for all that, evil never becomes a good. 1 598-600 . 1994 1 

313 “We know that in everything God works for good for those who love him.”12Q The constant 
witness of the saints confirms this truth: (227) 

St. Catherine of Siena said to “those who are scandalized and rebel against what happens to 
them”: “Everything comes from love, all is ordained for the salvation of man, God does 
nothing without this goal in mind. ”121 

St. Thomas More, shortly before his martyrdom, consoled his daughter: “Nothing can come 
but that that God wills. And I make me very sure that whatsoever that be, seem it never so bad 
in sight, it shall indeed be the best.”122 

Dame Julian of Norwich: “Here I was taught by the grace of God that I should steadfastly keep 
me in the faith... and that at the same time I should take my stand on and earnestly believe in 
what our Lord shewed in this time—that ‘all manner [of] thing shall be well. ’”122 











314 We firmly believe that God is master of the world and of its history. But the ways of his 
providence are often unknown to us. Only at the end, when our partial knowledge ceases, when we 
see God “face to face, ”1^4 will we fully know the ways by which—even through the dramas of evil 
and sin—God has guided his creation to that definitive sabbath restMi for which he created heaven 
and earth. ( 1040 . 2550) 


IN BRIEF 


315 In the creation of the world and of man, God gave the first and universal witness to his 
almighty love and his wisdom, the first proclamation of the “plan of his loving goodness,” which 
finds its goal in the new creation in Christ. 

316 Though the work of creation is attributed to the Father in particular, it is equally a truth of faith 
that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit together are the one, indivisible principle of creation. 

317 God alone created the universe freely, directly, and without any help. 

318 No creature has the infinite power necessary to “create” in the proper sense of the word, that is, 
to produce and give being to that which had in no way possessed it (to call into existence “out of 
nothing”) (cf. DS 3624). 

319 God created the world to show forth and communicate his glory. That his creatures should 
share in his truth, goodness, and beauty—this is the glory for which God created them. 

320 God created the universe and keeps it in existence by his Word, the Son “upholding the 
universe by his word of power” (Heb 1:3) and by his Creator Spirit, the giver of life. 

321 Divine providence consists of the dispositions by which God guides all his creatures with 
wisdom and love to their ultimate end. 

322 Christ invites us to filial trust in the providence of our heavenly Father (cf. Mt 6:26-34), and St. 
Peter the apostle repeats: “Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you” (1 Pet 5:7; cf. Ps 
55:23). 

323 Divine providence works also through the actions of creatures. To human beings God grants 
the ability to cooperate freely with his plans. 







324 The fact that God permits physical and even moral evil is a mystery that God illuminates by his 
Son Jesus Christ who died and rose to vanquish evil. Faith gives us the certainty that God would 
not permit an evil if he did not cause a good to come from that very evil, by ways that we shall 
fully know only in eternal life. 


Paragraph 5. Heaven and Earth 

325 The Apostles’ Creed professes that God is “Creator of heaven and earth.” The Nicene Creed 
makes it explicit that this profession includes “all that is, seen and unseen.” 

326 The Scriptural expression “heaven and earth” means all that exists, creation in its entirety. It 
also indicates the bond, deep within creation, that both unites heaven and earth and distinguishes 
the one from the other: “the earth” is the world of men, while “heaven” or “the heavens” can 
designate both the firmament and God’s own “place” — “our Father in heaven” and consequently 
the “heaven” too which is eschatological glory. Finally, “heaven” refers to the saints and the 
“place” of the spiritual creatures, the angels, who surround God.lSh (290, 1023 . 2794 1 

327 The profession of faith of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) affirms that God “from the 
beginning of time made at once ( simul ) out of nothing both orders of creatures, the spiritual and the 
corporeal, that is, the angelic and the earthly, and then ( deinde ) the human creature, who as it were 
shares in both orders, being composed of spirit and body.”1^2 (296) 

I. The Angels 


The existence of angels—a truth of faith 

328 The existence of the spiritual, non-corporeal beings that Sacred Scripture usually calls “angels” 
is a truth of faith. The witness of Scripture is as clear as the unanimity of Tradition. (150) 

Who are they? 

329 St. Augustine says: “’Angel’ is the name of their office, not of their nature. If you seek the 
name of their nature, it is ‘spirit’; if you seek the name of their office, it is ‘angel’: from what they 
are, ‘spirit,’ from what they do, ‘angel. ’”±^8 With their whole beings the angels are servants and 
messengers of God. Because they “always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven” they are 
the “mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word.”l£2 









330 As purely spiritual creatures angels have intelligence and will: they are personal and immortal 
creatures, surpassing in perfection all visible creatures, as the splendor of their glory bears 
witness.TJQ 


Christ “with all his angels” 

331 Christ is the center of the angelic world. They are his angels: “When the Son of man comes in 
his glory, and all the angels with him....”Tli They belong to him because they were created through 
and for him: “for in him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, 
whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities—all things were created through him 
and for him.”iT2 They belong to him still more because he has made them messengers of his saving 
plan: “Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to serve, for the sake of those who are to obtain 
salvation?”!^ ( 291 1 


332 Angels have been present since creation and throughout the history of salvation, announcing 
this salvation from afar or near and serving the accomplishment of the divine plan: they closed the 
earthly paradise; protected Lot; saved Hagar and her child; stayed Abraham’s hand; communicated 
the law by their ministry; led the People of God; announced births and callings; and assisted the 
prophets, just to cite a few examples.!^ Finally, the angel Gabriel announced the birth of the 
Precursor and that of Jesus himself.l^ 

333 From the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate is surrounded by the 
adoration and service of angels. When God “brings the firstborn into the world, he says: 'Let all 
God’s angels worship him.’”l^ Their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased 
resounding in the Church’s praise: “Glory to God in the highest!”!^ They protect Jesus in his 
infancy, serve him in the desert, strengthen him in his agony in the garden, when he could have 
been saved by them from the hands of his enemies as Israel had been.192 Again, it is the angels who 
“evangelize” by proclaiming the Good News of Christ’s Incarnation and Resurrection.TL! They will 
be present at Christ’s return, which they will announce, to serve at his judgment.^ (559) 

The angels in the life of the Church 

334 In the meantime, the whole life of the Church benefits from the mysterious and powerful help 
of angels.^CL (1939) 

335 In her liturgy, the Church joins with the angels to adore the thrice-holy God. She invokes their 
assistance (in the funeral liturgy’s In Paradisum deducant te angeli... “May the angels lead you into 





Paradise...”]). Moreover, in the “Cherubic Hymn” of the Byzantine Liturgy, she celebrates the 
memory of certain angels more particularly (St. Michael, St. Gabriel, St. Raphael, and the guardian 
angels). ( 1138 1 

336 From its beginning until death, human life is surrounded by their watchful care and 
intercession.^ “Beside each believer stands an angel as protector and shepherd leading him to 
life ”203 Already here on earth the Christian life shares by faith in the blessed company of angels 
and men united in God. 1 1020 1 

II. The Visible World 


337 God himself created the visible world in all its richness, diversity, and order. Scripture presents 
the work of the Creator symbolically as a succession of six days of divine “work,” concluded by the 
“rest” of the seventh day. 224 On the subject of creation, the sacred text teaches the truths revealed 
by God for our salvation, 222 permitting us to “recognize the inner nature, the value, and the 
ordering of the whole of creation to the praise of God.”222 1 290 . 293 1 

338 Nothing exists that does not owe its existence to God the Creator. The world began when 
God’s word drew it out of nothingness; all existent beings, all of nature, and all human history are 
rooted in this primordial event, the very genesis by which the world was constituted and time 
begun.22Z (297) 

339 Each creature possesses its own particular goodness and perfection. For each one of the works 
of the “six days” it is said: “And God saw that it was good.” “By the very nature of creation, 
material being is endowed with its own stability, truth, and excellence, its own order and laws. ”222 
Each of the various creatures, willed in its own being, reflects in its own way a ray of God’s infinite 
wisdom and goodness. Man must therefore respect the particular goodness of every creature, to 
avoid any disordered use of things which would be in contempt of the Creator and would bring 
disastrous consequences for human beings and their environment. 1 2501 . 299 . 266 1 

340 God wills the interdependence of creatures. The sun and the moon, the cedar and the little 
flower, the eagle and the sparrow: the spectacle of their countless diversities and inequalities tells 
us that no creature is self-sufficient. Creatures exist only in dependence on each other, to complete 
each other, in the service of each other. 1 1937 1 


341 The beauty of the universe: The order and harmony of the created world results from the 











diversity of beings and from the relationships which exist among them. Man discovers them 
progressively as the laws of nature. They call forth the admiration of scholars. The beauty of 
creation reflects the infinite beauty of the Creator and ought to inspire the respect and submission 
of man’s intellect and will. ( 283 . 2500 1 

342 The hierarchy of creatures is expressed by the order of the “six days,” from the less perfect to 
the more perfect. God loves all his creatures^ and takes care of each one, even the sparrow. 
Nevertheless, Jesus said: “You are of more value than many sparrows,” or again: “Of how much 
more value is a man than a sheep \”21Q (310) 

343 Man is the summit of the Creator’s work, as the inspired account expresses by clearly 
distinguishing the creation of man from that of the other creatures.TLi ( 355 ) 

344 There is a solidarity among all creatures arising from the fact that all have the same Creator 
and are all ordered to his glory: ( 293 . 1939 . 2416 . 1218 ) 

May you be praised, O Lord, in all your creatures, especially brother sun, by whom you give 
us light for the day; he is beautiful, radiating great splendor, and offering us a symbol of you, 
the Most High.... May you be praised, my Lord, for sister water, who is very useful and 
humble, precious and chaste.... May you be praised, my Lord, for sister earth, our mother, who 
bears and feeds us, and produces the variety of fruits and dappled flowers and grasses.... Praise 
and bless my Lord, give thanks and serve him in all humility.^L2 

345 The sabbath—the end of the work of the six days. The sacred text says that “on the seventh day 
God finished his work which he had done,” that the “heavens and the earth were finished,” and that 
God “rested” on this day and sanctified and blessed it.^ These inspired words are rich in 
profitable instruction: (2168) 

346 In creation God laid a foundation and established laws that remain firm, on which the believer 
can rely with confidence, for they are the sign and pledge of the unshakeable faithfulness of God’s 
covenant.^ For his part man must remain faithful to this foundation and respect the laws which 
the Creator has written into it. (2169) 

347 Creation was fashioned with a view to the sabbath and therefore for the worship and adoration 
of God. Worship is inscribed in the order of creation.^ As the rule of St. Benedict says, nothing 
should take precedence over “the work of God,” that is, solemn worship.^ This indicates the right 
order of human concerns. 11145-1152 1 













348 The sabbath is at the heart of Israel’s law. To keep the commandments is to correspond to the 
wisdom and the will of God as expressed in his work of creation. 1 2172 1 


349 The eighth day. But for us a new day has dawned: the day of Christ’s Resurrection. The 
seventh day completes the first creation. The eighth day begins the new creation. Thus, the work of 
creation culminates in the greater work of redemption. The first creation finds its meaning and its 
summit in the new creation in Christ, the splendor of which surpasses that of the first creation.Hl 
1 2174 . 1046 1 


IN BRIEF 


350 Angels are spiritual creatures who glorify God without ceasing and who serve his saving plans 
for other creatures: “The angels work together for the benefit of us all” (St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I, 
114, 3, ad 3). 

351 The angels surround Christ their Lord. They serve him especially in the accomplishment of his 
saving mission to men. 

352 The Church venerates the angels who help her on her earthly pilgrimage and protect every 
human being. 

353 God willed the diversity of his creatures and their own particular goodness, their 
interdependence, and their order. He destined all material creatures for the good of the human race. 
Man, and through him all creation, is destined for the glory of God. 

354 Respect for laws inscribed in creation and the relations which derive from the nature of things 
is a principle of wisdom and a foundation for morality.

Paragraph 6. Man 

355 “God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he 
created them.”218 ]y[ an occupies a unique place in creation: (I) he is “in the image of God”; (II) in 
his own nature he unites the spiritual and material worlds; (III) he is created “male and female”; 
(IV) God established him in his friendship. 1 1700 . 343 1 

I. "In the Image of God” 


356 Of all visible creatures only man is “able to know and love his creator.”212 He is “the only 
creature on earth that God has willed for its own sake, ”222 and he alone is called to share, by 
knowledge and love, in God’s own life. It was for this end that he was created, and this is the 




fundamental reason for his dignity: (1703 . 2258 . 225 . 295) 


What made you establish man in so great a dignity? Certainly the incalculable love by which 
you have looked on your creature in yourself! You are taken with love for her; for by love 
indeed you created her, by love you have given her a being capable of tasting your eternal 
Good.22i 


357 Being in the image of God the human individual possesses the dignity of a person, who is not 
just something, but someone. He is capable of self-knowledge, of self-possession and of freely 
giving himself and entering into communion with other persons. And he is called by grace to a 
covenant with his Creator, to offer him a response of faith and love that no other creature can give 
in his stead. ( 1935 . 1877 1 

358 God created everything for man,222 but man in turn was created to serve and love God and to 
offer all creation back to him: (222, 901 ) 

What is it that is about to be created, that enjoys such honor? It is man—that great and 
wonderful living creature, more precious in the eyes of God than all other creatures! For him 
the heavens and the earth, the sea and all the rest of creation exist. God attached so much 
importance to his salvation that he did not spare his own Son for the sake of man. Nor does he 
ever cease to work, trying every possible means, until he has raised man up to himself and 
made him sit at his right hand.223 

359 “In reality it is only in the mystery of the Word made flesh that the mystery of man truly 
becomes clear. ”224 (1701, 388, 411 ) 

St. Paul tells us that the human race takes its origin from two men: Adam and Christ.... The 
first man, Adam, he says, became a living soul, the last Adam a life-giving spirit. The first 
Adam was made by the last Adam, from whom he also received his soul, to give him life.... 
The second Adam stamped his image on the first Adam when he created him. That is why he 
took on himself the role and the name of the first Adam, in order that he might not lose what 
he had made in his own image. The first Adam, the last Adam: the first had a beginning, the 
last knows no end. The last Adam is indeed the first; as he himself says: “I am the first and the 
last.”225 

360 Because of its common origin the human race forms a unity, for “from one ancestor [God] 
made all nations to inhabit the whole earth”;226 (225 . 404 . 775 . 831 . 842 1 


















O wondrous vision, which makes us contemplate the human race in the unity of its origin in 
God... in the unity of its nature, composed equally in all men of a material body and a spiritual 
soul; in the unity of its immediate end and its mission in the world; in the unity of its dwelling, 
the earth, whose benefits all men, by right of nature, may use to sustain and develop life; in the 
unity of its supernatural end: God himself, to whom all ought to tend; in the unity of the means 
for attaining this end;... in the unity of the redemption wrought by Christ for all.22Z 

361 “This law of human solidarity and charity, ”222 without excluding the rich variety of persons, 
cultures, and peoples, assures us that all men are truly brethren. (1939) 

II. “Body and Soul but Truly One” 


362 The human person, created in the image of God, is a being at once corporeal and spiritual. The 
biblical account expresses this reality in symbolic language when it affirms that “then the LORD 
God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man 
became a living being. ”222 Man, whole and entire, is therefore willed by God. ( 1146 . 2332 1 

363 In Sacred Scripture the term “soul” often refers to human life or the entire human person .222 
But “soul” also refers to the innermost aspect of man, that which is of greatest value in him, 221 that 
by which he is most especially in God’s image: “soul” signifies the spiritual principle in man. 
(1703) 

364 The human body shares in the dignity of “the image of God”: it is a human body precisely 
because it is animated by a spiritual soul, and it is the whole human person that is intended to 
become, in the body of Christ, a temple of the Spirit;222 (1004, 2289 ) 

Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity. Through his very bodily condition he sums up 
in himself the elements of the material world. Through him they are thus brought to their 
highest perfection and can raise their voice in praise freely given to the Creator. For this 
reason man may not despise his bodily life. Rather he is obliged to regard his body as good 
and to hold it in honor since God has created it and will raise it up on the last day.222 

365 The unity of soul and body is so profound that one has to consider the soul to be the “form” of 
the body;224 i.e., it is because of its spiritual soul that the body made of matter becomes a living, 
human body; spirit and matter, in man, are not two natures united, but rather their union forms a 
single nature. 








366 The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created immediately by God—it is not 
“produced” by the parents—and also that it is immortal: it does not perish when it separates from 
the body at death, and it will be reunited with the body at the final Resurrection.^ ( 1005 . 997) 

367 Sometimes the soul is distinguished from the spirit: St. Paul for instance prays that God may 
sanctify his people “wholly,” with “spirit and soul and body” kept sound and blameless at the 
Lord’s coming.236 The Church teaches that this distinction does not introduce a duality into the 
soul.— “Spirit” signifies that from creation man is ordered to a supernatural end and that his soul 
can gratuitously be raised beyond all it deserves to communion with God.^8 ( 2083 1 

368 The spiritual tradition of the Church also emphasizes the heart, in the biblical sense of the 
depths of one’s being, where the person decides for or against God.^39 ( 478 . 582 . 1431 . 1764 . 
2517 . 2562 . 2843 1 

III. “Male and Female He Created Them” 2331-2336 


Equality and difference willed by God 

369 Man and woman have been created, which is to say, willed by God: on the one hand, in perfect 
equality as human persons; on the other, in their respective beings as man and woman. “Being 
man” or “being woman” is a reality which is good and willed by God: man and woman possess an 
inalienable dignity which comes to them immediately from God their Creator.^ Man and woman 
are both with one and the same dignity “in the image of God.” In their “being-man” and “being- 
woman,” they reflect the Creator’s wisdom and goodness. 

370 In no way is God in man’s image. He is neither man nor woman. God is pure spirit in which 
there is no place for the difference between the sexes. But the respective “perfections” of man and 
woman reflect something of the infinite perfection of God: those of a mother and those of a father 
and husband.241 (42, 239 1 

“Each for the other ” — “A unity in two” 

371 God created man and woman together and willed each for the other. The Word of God gives us 
to understand this through various features of the sacred text. “It is not good that the man should be 
alone. I will make him a helper fit for him.”^2 None of the animals can be man’s partner.243 The 
woman God “fashions” from the man’s rib and brings to him elicits on the man’s part a cry of 
wonder, an exclamation of love and communion: “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my 














flesh.”244 Man discovers woman as another “I,” sharing the same humanity. ( 1605 ) 


372 Man and woman were made “for each other” — not that God left them half-made and 
incomplete: he created them to be a communion of persons, in which each can be “helpmate” to the 
other, for they are equal as persons (“bone of my bones...”) and complementary as masculine and 
feminine. In marriage God unites them in such a way that, by forming “one flesh, ”242 they can 
transmit human life: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. ”216 gy transmitting human life to 
their descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents cooperate in a unique way in the 
Creator’s work.24Z ( 1652 . 2366 1 

373 In God’s plan man and woman have the vocation of “subduing” the earth242 as stewards of 
God. This sovereignty is not to be an arbitrary and destructive domination. God calls man and 
woman, made in the image of the Creator “who loves everything that exists, ”212 to share in his 
providence toward other creatures; hence their responsibility for the world God has entrusted to 
them. (307, 2415 1 

IV. Man in Paradise 


374 The first man was not only created good, but was also established in friendship with his 
Creator and in harmony with himself and with the creation around him, in a state that would be 
surpassed only by the glory of the new creation in Christ. (54) 

375 The Church, interpreting the symbolism of biblical language in an authentic way, in the light of 
the New Testament and Tradition, teaches that our first parents, Adam and Eve, were constituted in 
an original “state of holiness and justice. ”226 This grace of original holiness was “to share in... 
divine life. ”221 ( 1997 1 


376 By the radiance of this grace all dimensions of man’s life were confirmed. As long as he 
remained in the divine intimacy, man would not have to suffer or die. 222 The inner harmony of the 
human person, the harmony between man and woman, 222 and finally the harmony between the first 
couple and all creation, comprised the state called “original justice.” ( 1008 . 1502 1 

377 The “mastery” over the world that God offered man from the beginning was realized above all 
within man himself: mastery of self. The first man was unimpaired and ordered in his whole being 
because he was free from the triple concupiscence224 that subjugates him to the pleasures of the 
senses, covetousness for earthly goods, and self-assertion, contrary to the dictates of reason. ( 2514 1 











378 The sign of man’s familiarity with God is that God places him in the garden.^ There he lives 
“to till it and keep it.” Work is not yet a burden,^ but rather the collaboration of man and woman 
with God in perfecting the visible creation. ( 2415 . 2427 1 

379 This entire harmony of original justice, foreseen for man in God’s plan, will be lost by the sin 
of our first parents. 


IN BRIEF 


380 “Father,... you formed man in your own likeness and set him over the whole world to serve 
you, his creator, and to rule over all creatures” (Roman Missal, EP IV 118). 

381 Man is predestined to reproduce the image of God’s Son made man, the “image of the invisible 
God” (Co/ 1:15), so that Christ shall be the first-born of a multitude of brothers and sisters (cf. Eph 
1:3-6; Rom 8:29). 

382 “Man, though made of body and soul, is a unity” (GS 14 § 1). The doctrine of the faith affirms 
that the spiritual and immortal soul is created immediately by God. 

383 “God did not create man a solitary being. From the beginning, ‘male and female he created 
them’ (Gen 1:27). This partnership of man and woman constitutes the first form of communion 
between persons” (GS 12 § 4). 

384 Revelation makes known to us the state of original holiness and justice of man and woman 
before sin: from their friendship with God flowed the happiness of their existence in paradise. 


Paragraph 7. The Fall 

385 God is infinitely good and all his works are good. Yet no one can escape the experience of 
suffering or the evils in nature which seem to be linked to the limitations proper to creatures: and 
above all to the question of moral evil. Where does evil come from? “I sought whence evil comes 
and there was no solution,” said St. Augustine, 25Z and his own painful quest would only be 
resolved by his conversion to the living God. For “the mystery of lawlessness” is clarified only in 
the light of the “mystery of our religion.”^ The revelation of divine love in Christ manifested at 
the same time the extent of evil and the superabundance of grace. 259 \y e mus t therefore approach 











the question of the origin of evil by fixing the eyes of our faith on him who alone is its 
conqueror.^ (309, 457, 1848, 539) 


I. Where Sin Abounded, Grace Abounded All the More 


The reality of sin 

386 Sin is present in human history; any attempt to ignore it or to give this dark reality other names 
would be futile. To try to understand what sin is, one must first recognize the profound relation of 
man to God, for only in this relationship is the evil of sin unmasked in its true identity as 
humanity’s rejection of God and opposition to him, even as it continues to weigh heavy on human 
life and history. ( 1847 ) 

387 Only the light of divine Revelation clarifies the reality of sin and particularly of the sin 
committed at mankind’s origins. Without the knowledge Revelation gives of God we cannot 
recognize sin clearly and are tempted to explain it as merely a developmental flaw, a psychological 
weakness, a mistake, or the necessary consequence of an inadequate social structure, etc. Only in 
the knowledge of God’s plan for man can we grasp that sin is an abuse of the freedom that God 
gives to created persons so that they are capable of loving him and loving one another. 1 1848 . 
1739 ) 

Original Sin—an essential truth of the faith 

388 With the progress of Revelation, the reality of sin is also illuminated. Although to some extent 
the People of God in the Old Testament had tried to understand the pathos of the human condition 
in the light of the history of the fall narrated in Genesis, they could not grasp this story’s ultimate 
meaning, which is revealed only in the light of the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.^hl We 
must know Christ as the source of grace in order to know Adam as the source of sin. The Spirit- 
Paraclete, sent by the risen Christ, came to “convict the world concerning sin,”2h2 by revealing him 
who is its Redeemer. ( 431 . 208 . 359 . 729 ) 

389 The doctrine of original sin is, so to speak, the “reverse side” of the Good News that Jesus is 
the Savior of all men, that all need salvation, and that salvation is offered to all through Christ. The 
Church, which has the mind of Christ,^ knows very well that we cannot tamper with the 
revelation of original sin without undermining the mystery of Christ. ( 422 ) 


How to read the account of the Fall 














390 The account of the fall in Genesis 3 uses figurative language, but affirms a primeval event, a 
deed that took place at the beginning of the history of man.2M Revelation gives us the certainty of 
faith that the whole of human history is marked by the original fault freely committed by our first 
parents .^2 (289) 

II. The Fall of the Angels 


391 Behind the disobedient choice of our first parents lurks a seductive voice, opposed to God, 
which makes them fall into death out of envy.266 Scripture and the Church’s Tradition see in this 
being a fallen angel, called “Satan” or the “devil. ”2h2 The Church teaches that Satan was at first a 
good angel, made by God: “The devil and the other demons were indeed created naturally good by 
God, but they became evil by their own doing.”262 ( 2538 1 

392 Scripture speaks of a sin of these angels.^hH This “fall” consists in the free choice of these 
created spirits, who radically and irrevocably rejected God and his reign. We find a reflection of 
that rebellion in the tempter’s words to our first parents: “You will be like God.”22Q The devil “has 
sinned from the beginning”; he is “a liar and the father of lies.”2Zl ( 1850 . 2482 1 

393 It is the irrevocable character of their choice, and not a defect in the infinite divine mercy, that 
makes the angels’ sin unforgivable. “There is no repentance for the angels after their fall, just as 
there is no repentance for men after death. ”222 ( 1033-1037 . 1022 1 

394 Scripture witnesses to the disastrous influence of the one Jesus calls “a murderer from the 
beginning,” who would even try to divert Jesus from the mission received from his Father.223 “The 
reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. ”2Z4 \ n its consequences the 
gravest of these works was the mendacious seduction that led man to disobey God. 1 538-540 . 550 . 
2846-2849 1 

395 The power of Satan is, nonetheless, not infinite. He is only a creature, powerful from the fact 
that he is pure spirit, but still a creature. He cannot prevent the building up of God’s reign. 
Although Satan may act in the world out of hatred for God and his kingdom in Christ Jesus, and 
although his action may cause grave injuries—of a spiritual nature and, indirectly, even of a 
physical nature—to each man and to society, the action is permitted by divine providence which 
with strength and gentleness guides human and cosmic history. It is a great mystery that providence 
should permit diabolical activity, but “we know that in everything God works for good with those 
who love him.”2Z5 Q09, 1673 , 412, 2850-2854 1 
















III. Original Sin 


Freedom put to the test 

396 God created man in his image and established him in his friendship. A spiritual creature, man 
can live this friendship only in free submission to God. The prohibition against eating “of the tree 
of the knowledge of good and evil” spells this out: “for in the day that you eat of it, you shall 
die. ”276 jhg “ tree 0 f thg knowledge of good and evil”^2 symbolically evokes the insurmountable 
limits that man, being a creature, must freely recognize and respect with trust. Man is dependent on 
his Creator and subject to the laws of creation and to the moral norms that govern the use of 
freedom. (1730, 3U, 301 3 

Man’s first sin 

397 Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die in his heart and, abusing his freedom, 
disobeyed God’s command. This is what man’s first sin consisted of. ^ All subsequent sin would 
be disobedience toward God and lack of trust in his goodness. ( 1707 . 2541 . 1850 . 215 ) 

398 In that sin man preferred himself to God and by that very act scorned him. He chose himself 
over and against God, against the requirements of his creaturely status and therefore against his 
own good. Constituted in a state of holiness, man was destined to be fully “divinized” by God in 
glory. Seduced by the devil, he wanted to “be like God,” but “without God, before God, and not in 
accordance with God.”^ (2084, 2113 1 

399 Scripture portrays the tragic consequences of this first disobedience. Adam and Eve 
immediately lose the grace of original holiness.^ They become afraid of the God of whom they 
have conceived a distorted image—that of a God jealous of his prerogatives. 

400 The harmony in which they had found themselves, thanks to original justice, is now destroyed: 
the control of the soul’s spiritual faculties over the body is shattered; the union of man and woman 
becomes subject to tensions, their relations henceforth marked by lust and domination.^ Harmony 
with creation is broken: visible creation has become alien and hostile to man.^83 Because of man, 
creation is now subject “to its bondage to decay.”^4 Finally, the consequence explicitly foretold 
for this disobedience will come true: man will “return to the ground,f or ou t 0 f it he was taken. 
Death makes its entrance into human history ( 1607 . 2514 . 602 . 1008) 


401 After that first sin, the world is virtually inundated by sin. There is Cain’s murder of his brother 
















Abel and the universal corruption which follows in the wake of sin. Likewise, sin frequently 
manifests itself in the history of Israel, especially as infidelity to the God of the Covenant and as 
transgression of the Law of Moses. And even after Christ’s atonement, sin raises its head in 
countless ways among Christians. 2LZ Scripture and the Church’s Tradition continually recall the 
presence and universality of sin in man’s history: 1 1865 . 2259 . 1739 1 

What Revelation makes known to us is confirmed by our own experience. For when man 
looks into his own heart he finds that he is drawn toward what is wrong and sunk in many 
evils which cannot come from his good creator. Often refusing to acknowledge God as his 
source, man has also upset the relationship which should link him to his last end; and at the 
same time he has broken the right order that should reign within himself as well as between 
himself and other men and all creatures. 222 

The consequences of Adam’s sin for humanity 

402 All men are implicated in Adam’s sin, as St. Paul affirms: “By one man’s disobedience many 
[that is, all men] were made sinners”: “sin came into the world through one man and death through 
sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned.... ”222 The Apostle contrasts the 
universality of sin and death with the universality of salvation in Christ. “Then as one man’s 
trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man’s act of righteousness leads to acquittal and 
life for all men.”220 [ 430 . 605) 

403 Following St. Paul, the Church has always taught that the overwhelming misery which 
oppresses men and their inclination toward evil and death cannot be understood apart from their 
connection with Adam’s sin and the fact that he has transmitted to us a sin with which we are all 
born afflicted, a sin which is the “death of the soul. ”291 Because of this certainty of faith, the 
Church baptizes for the remission of sins even tiny infants who have not committed personal 
sin. 222 (2606, 1250 1 

404 How did the sin of Adam become the sin of all his descendants? The whole human race is in 
Adam “as one body of one man.”222 By this “unity of the human race” all men are implicated in 
Adam’s sin, as all are implicated in Christ’s justice. Still, the transmission of original sin is a 
mystery that we cannot fully understand. But we do know by Revelation that Adam had received 
original holiness and justice not for himself alone, but for all human nature. By yielding to the 
tempter, Adam and Eve committed a personal sin, but this sin affected the human nature that they 
would then transmit in a fallen state. 224 it i s a sin which will be transmitted by propagation to all 









mankind, that is, by the transmission of a human nature deprived of original holiness and justice. 
And that is why original sin is called “sin” only in an analogical sense: it is a sin “contracted” and 
not “committed” — a state and not an act. (360, 50) 

405 Although it is proper to each individual, 225 original sin does not have the character of a 
personal fault in any of Adam’s descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but 
human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it; 
subject to ignorance, suffering, and the dominion of death; and inclined to sin—an inclination to 
evil that is called “concupiscence.” Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ’s grace, erases original 
sin and turns a man back toward God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to 
evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle. 1 2515 . 1264 1 

406 The Church’s teaching on the transmission of original sin was articulated more precisely in the 
fifth century, especially under the impulse of St. Augustine’s reflections against Pelagianism, and 
in the sixteenth century, in opposition to the Protestant Reformation. Pelagius held that man could, 
by the natural power of free will and without the necessary help of God’s grace, lead a morally 
good life; he thus reduced the influence of Adam’s fault to bad example. The first Protestant 
reformers, on the contrary, taught that original sin has radically perverted man and destroyed his 
freedom; they identified the sin inherited by each man with the tendency to evil (concupiscentia), 
which would be insurmountable. The Church pronounced on the meaning of the data of Revelation 
on original sin especially at the second Council of Orange (529)226 anc i at t p e Council of Trent 
(1546)227 

A hard battle... 

407 The doctrine of original sin, closely connected with that of redemption by Christ, provides 
lucid discernment of man’s situation and activity in the world. By our first parents’ sin, the devil 
has acquired a certain domination over man, even though man remains free. Original sin entails 
“captivity under the power of him who thenceforth had the power of death, that is, the devil. ”222 
Ignorance of the fact that man has a wounded nature inclined to evil gives rise to serious errors in 
the areas of education, politics, social action, 229 anc [ m0 rals. ( 2015 . 2852 . 1888 ) 

408 The consequences of original sin and of all men’s personal sins put the world as a whole in the 
sinful condition aptly described in St. John’s expression, “the sin of the world.”222 This expression 
can also refer to the negative influence exerted on people by communal situations and social 
structures that are the fruit of men’s sins.221 ( 1865 ) 









409 This dramatic situation of “the whole world [which] is in the power of the evil one”2Q2 makes 
man’s life a battle: [ 2516 1 


The whole of man’s history has been the story of dour combat with the powers of evil, 
stretching, so our Lord tells us, from the very dawn of history until the last day. Finding 
himself in the midst of the battlefield man has to struggle to do what is right, and it is at great 
cost to himself, and aided by God’s grace, that he succeeds in achieving his own inner 
integrity.^ 


IV. “You Did Not Abandon Him to the Power of Death” 


410 After his fall, man was not abandoned by God. On the contrary, God calls him and in a 
mysterious way heralds the coming victory over evil and his restoration from his fall.224 This 
passage in Genesis is called the Protoevangelium (“first gospel”): the first announcement of the 
Messiah and Redeemer, of a battle between the serpent and the Woman, and of the final victory of 
a descendant of hers. (55, 705, 1609 . 2568 . 675 1 

411 The Christian tradition sees in this passage an announcement of the “New Adam” who, 
because he “became obedient unto death, even death on a cross,” makes amends superabundantly 
for the disobedience of Adam.^ Furthermore many Fathers and Doctors of the Church have seen 
the woman announced in the Protoevangelium as Mary, the mother of Christ, the “new Eve.” Mary 
benefited first of all and uniquely from Christ’s victory over sin: she was preserved from all stain of 
original sin and by a special grace of God committed no sin of any kind during her whole earthly 
life.306 ( 359 ^ 615^ 491 1 

412 But why did God not prevent the first man from sinning? St. Leo the Great responds, “Christ’s 
inexpressible grace gave us blessings better than those the demon’s envy had taken away.”2EZ And 
St. Thomas Aquinas wrote, “There is nothing to prevent human nature’s being raised up to 
something greater, even after sin; God permits evil in order to draw forth some greater good. Thus 
St. Paul says, 'Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more’; and the Exultet sings, ‘O happy 
fault,... which gained for us so great a Redeemer!”’^ [ 310 . 395 . 272 . 1994 1 


IN BRIEF 
















413 “God did not make death, and he does not delight in the death of the living.... It was through 
the devil’s envy that death entered the world” (Wis 1:13; 2:24). 

414 Satan or the devil and the other demons are fallen angels who have freely refused to serve God 
and his plan. Their choice against God is definitive. They try to associate man in their revolt against 
God. 

415 “Although set by God in a state of rectitude, man, enticed by the evil one, abused his freedom 
at the very start of history. He lifted himself up against God and sought to attain his goal apart from 
him” (GS 13 § 1). 

416 By his sin Adam, as the first man, lost the original holiness and justice he had received from 
God, not only for himself but for all human beings. 

417 Adam and Eve transmitted to their descendants human nature wounded by their own first sin 
and hence deprived of original holiness and justice; this deprivation is called “original sin.” 

418 As a result of original sin, human nature is weakened in its powers; subject to ignorance, 
suffering, and the domination of death; and inclined to sin (This inclination is called 
“concupiscence.”). 

419 “We therefore hold, with the Council of Trent, that original sin is transmitted with human 
nature, ‘by propagation, not by imitation’ and that it is... ‘proper to each’” (Paul VI, CPG § 16). 

420 The victory that Christ won over sin has given us greater blessings than those which sin had 
taken from us: “where sin increased, grace abounded all the more” (Rom 5:20). 

421 Christians believe that “the world has been established and kept in being by the Creator’s love; 
has fallen into slavery to sin but has been set free by Christ, crucified and risen to break the power 
of the evil one...” (GS 2 § 2).

CHAPTER TWO 

I BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST, THE ONLY SON OF GOD 


The Good News: God has sent his Son 

422 “But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the 
law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.”l This is 
“the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God”:- God has visited his people. He has fulfilled the 
promise he made to Abraham and his descendants. He acted far beyond all expectation—he has 
sent his own “beloved Son.”2 (389, 2763 1 

423 We believe and confess that Jesus of Nazareth, born a Jew of a daughter of Israel at Bethlehem 
at the time of King Herod the Great and the emperor Caesar Augustus, a carpenter by trade, who 
died crucified in Jerusalem under the procurator Pontius Pilate during the reign of the emperor 
Tiberius, is the eternal Son of God made man. He “came from God,“descended from heaven,”^ 
and “came in the flesh.”§ For “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; 
we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.... And from his fullness have 
we all received, grace upon grace. 

424 Moved by the grace of the Holy Spirit and drawn by the Father, we believe in Jesus and 
confess: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”^ On the rock of this faith confessed by St. 
Peter, Christ built his Church.^ (683, 552 1 

“To preach... the unsearchable riches of Christ”^ 

425 The transmission of the Christian faith consists primarily in proclaiming Jesus Christ in order 
to lead others to faith in him. From the beginning, the first disciples burned with the desire to 
proclaim Christ: “We cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard. And they invite people 
of every era to enter into the joy of their communion with Christ: (850, 858 1 

That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, 
which we have looked upon and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—the life 
was made manifest, and we saw it, and testify to it, and proclaim to you the eternal life which 
was with the Father and was made manifest to us—that which we have seen and heard we 
proclaim also to you, so that you may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the 
Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. And we are writing this that our joy may be complete.^ 









At the heart of catechesis: Christ 


426 “At the heart of catechesis we find, in essence, a Person, the Person of Jesus of Nazareth, the 
only Son from the Father... who suffered and died for us and who now, after rising, is living with us 
forever.”^ To catechize is “to reveal in the Person of Christ the whole of God’s eternal design 
reaching fulfillment in that Person. It is to seek to understand the meaning of Christ’s actions and 
words and of the signs worked by him.”14 Catechesis aims at putting “people... in communion... 
with Jesus Christ: only he can lead us to the love of the Father in the Spirit and make us share in the 
life of the Holy Trinity.”!^ 1 1698 . 513 . 260) 

427 In catechesis “Christ, the Incarnate Word and Son of God,... is taught—everything else is 
taught with reference to him—and it is Christ alone who teaches—anyone else teaches to the extent 
that he is Christ’s spokesman, enabling Christ to teach with his lips.... Every catechist should be 
able to apply to himself the mysterious words of Jesus: 'My teaching is not mine, but his who sent 
me.’”J£ 1 2145 . 876 1 

428 Whoever is called “to teach Christ” must first seek “the surpassing worth of knowing Christ 
Jesus”; he must suffer “the loss of all things...” in order to “gain Christ and be found in him,” and 
“to know him and the power of his resurrection, and [to] share his sufferings, becoming like him in 
his death, that if possible [he] may attain the resurrection from the dead.”12 

429 From this loving knowledge of Christ springs the desire to proclaim him, to “evangelize,” and 
to lead others to the “yes” of faith in Jesus Christ. But at the same time the need to know this faith 
better makes itself felt. To this end, following the order of the Creed, Jesus’ principal titles — 
“Christ,” “Son of God,” and “Lord” (article 2) —will be presented. The Creed next confesses the 
chief mysteries of his life—those of his Incarnation (article 3), Paschal mystery (articles 4 and 5), 
and glorification (articles 6 and 7). 1 851 1 

ARTICLE 2 

“AND IN JESUS CHRIST, HIS ONLY SON, OUR LORD” 


I. Jesus 

430 Jesus means in Hebrew: “God saves.” At the annunciation, the angel Gabriel gave him the 
name Jesus as his proper name, which expresses both his identity and his mission.!^ Since God 
alone can forgive sins, it is God who, in Jesus his eternal Son made man, “will save his people from 












their sins.”l^ In Jesus, God recapitulates all of his history of salvation on behalf of men. 1 210 . 402 1 


431 In the history of salvation God was not content to deliver Israel “out of the house of 
bondage”^ by bringing them out of Egypt. He also saves them from their sin. Because sin is 
always an offense against God, only he can forgive it.^i For this reason Israel, becoming more and 
more aware of the universality of sin, will no longer be able to seek salvation except by invoking 
the name of the Redeemer God.^2 (1441 . 1850 . 388 1 

432 The name “Jesus” signifies that the very name of God is present in the person of his Son, made 
man for the universal and definitive redemption from sins. It is the divine name that alone brings 
salvation, and henceforth all can invoke his name, for Jesus united himself to all men through his 
Incarnation,^ so that “there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be 
saved.”— (589, 2666, 389, 161 1 

433 The name of the Savior God was invoked only once in the year by the high priest in atonement 
for the sins of Israel, after he had sprinkled the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies with the sacrificial 
blood. The mercy seat was the place of God’s presence.^ When St. Paul speaks of Jesus whom 
“God put forward as an expiation by his blood,” he means that in Christ’s humanity “God was in 
Christ reconciling the world to himself. ( 615 1 

434 Jesus’ Resurrection glorifies the name of the Savior God, for from that time on it is the name of 
Jesus that fully manifests the supreme power of the “name which is above every name.”^ - The evil 
spirits fear his name; in his name his disciples perform miracles, for the Father grants all they ask in 
this name.22 (2812 . 2614 1 

435 The name of Jesus is at the heart of Christian prayer. All liturgical prayers conclude with the 
words “through our Lord Jesus Christ.” The Hail Mary reaches its high point in the words “blessed 
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.” The Eastern prayer of the heart, the Jesus Prayer, says: “Lord 
Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.” Many Christians, such as St. Joan of Arc, 
have died with the one word “Jesus” on their lips. ( 2667-2668 . 2676 1 

II. Christ 

436 The word “Christ” comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew Messiah, which means 
“anointed.” It became the name proper to Jesus only because he accomplished perfectly the divine 
mission that “Christ” signifies. In effect, in Israel those consecrated to God for a mission that he 
gave were anointed in his name. This was the case for kings, for priests and, in rare instances, for 
















prophets.^ This had to be the case all the more so for the Messiah whom God would send to 
inaugurate his kingdom definitively.^ It was necessary that the Messiah be anointed by the Spirit 
of the Lord at once as king and priest, and also as prophet.21 Jesus fulfilled the messianic hope of 
Israel in his threefold office of priest, prophet, and king. (690, 695, 711-716 . 783 1 

437 To the shepherds, the angel announced the birth of Jesus as the Messiah promised to Israel: 
“To you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. ”22 From the 
beginning he was “the one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world,” conceived as 
“holy” in Mary’s virginal womb. 22 God called Joseph to “take Mary as your wife, for that which is 
conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit,” so that Jesus, “who is called Christ,” should be born of 
Joseph’s spouse into the messianic lineage of David.24 (525, 486 1 

438 Jesus’ messianic consecration reveals his divine mission, “for the name ‘Christ’ implies ‘he 
who anointed,’ ‘he who was anointed’ and ‘the very anointing with which he was anointed.’ The 
one who anointed is the Father, the one who was anointed is the Son, and he was anointed with the 
Spirit who is the anointing.”^ His eternal messianic consecration was revealed during the time of 
his earthly life at the moment of his baptism by John, when “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with 
the Holy Spirit and with power,” “that he might be revealed to Israel”2h as its Messiah. His works 
and words will manifest him as “the Holy One of God. ”27 (727, 535 1 

439 Many Jews and even certain Gentiles who shared their hope recognized in Jesus the 
fundamental attributes of the messianic “Son of David,” promised by God to Israel.22 Jesus 
accepted his rightful title of Messiah, though with some reserve because it was understood by some 
of his contemporaries in too human a sense, as essentially political. 22 1 528-529 . 547 1 

440 Jesus accepted Peter’s profession of faith, which acknowledged him to be the Messiah, by 
announcing the imminent Passion of the Son of Man.^2 He unveiled the authentic content of his 
messianic kingship both in the transcendent identity of the Son of Man “who came down from 
heaven,” and in his redemptive mission as the suffering Servant: “The Son of Man came not to be 
served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. ”41 Hence the true meaning of his 
kingship is revealed only when he is raised high on the cross.42 Only after his Resurrection will 
Peter be able to proclaim Jesus’ messianic kingship to the People of God: “Let all the house of 
Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you 
crucified.”42 (552, 550, 445 1 


III. The Only Son of God 















441 In the Old Testament, “son of God” is a title given to the angels, the Chosen People, the 
children of Israel, and their kings.44 It signifies an adoptive sonship that establishes a relationship 
of particular intimacy between God and his creature. When the promised Messiah-King is called 
“son of God,” it does not necessarily imply that he was more than human, according to the literal 
meaning of these texts. Those who called Jesus “son of God,” as the Messiah of Israel, perhaps 
meant nothing more than this. 

442 Such is not the case for Simon Peter when he confesses Jesus as “the Christ, the Son of the 
living God,” for Jesus responds solemnly: “Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my 
Father who is in heaven. ”45 Similarly Paul will write, regarding his conversion on the road to 
Damascus, “When he who had set me apart before I was born, and had called me through his grace, 
was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles.... ”4Z 
“And in the synagogues immediately [Paul] proclaimed Jesus, saying, 'He is the Son of God.’”4§ 
From the beginning this acknowledgment of Christ’s divine sonship will be the center of the 
apostolic faith, first professed by Peter as the Church’s foundation^ (552, 424) 

443 Peter could recognize the transcendent character of the Messiah’s divine sonship because Jesus 
had clearly allowed it to be so understood. To his accusers’ question before the Sanhedrin, “Are 
you the Son of God, then?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am.”5Q Well before this, Jesus referred 
to himself as “the Son” who knows the Father, as distinct from the “servants” God had earlier sent 
to his people; he is superior even to the angels.^i He distinguished his sonship from that of his 
disciples by never saying “our Father,” except to command them: “You, then, pray like this: ‘Our 
Father,”’ and he emphasized this distinction, saying “my Father and your Father.”52 [ 2786 1 

444 The Gospels report that at two solemn moments, the Baptism and the Transfiguration of Christ, 
the voice of the Father designates Jesus his “beloved Son.”55 Jesus calls himself the “only Son of 
God,” and by this title affirms his eternal preexistence. ^4 He asks for faith in “the name of the only 
Son of God.”55 In the centurion’s exclamation before the crucified Christ, “Truly this man was the 
Son of God,”^ that Christian confession is already heard. Only in the Paschal mystery can the 
believer give the title “Son of God” its full meaning. [ 536 . 554 1 

445 After his Resurrection, Jesus’ divine sonship becomes manifest in the power of his glorified 
humanity. He was “designated Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his 
Resurrection from the dead.”^ The apostles can confess: “We have beheld his glory, glory as of 
the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.”52 [ 653 1 


IV. Lord 








446 In the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the ineffable Hebrew name YHWH, by which 
God revealed himself to Moses,is rendered as Kyrios, “Lord.” From then on, “Lord” becomes 
the more usual name by which to indicate the divinity of Israel’s God. The New Testament uses 
this full sense of the title “Lord” both for the Father and—what is new—for Jesus, who is thereby 
recognized as God Himself. (209) 

447 Jesus ascribes this title to himself in a veiled way when he disputes with the Pharisees about 
the meaning of Psalm 110, but also in an explicit way when he addresses his apostles.^! 
Throughout his public life, he demonstrated his divine sovereignty by works of power over nature, 
illnesses, demons, death, and sin. (548) 

448 Very often in the Gospels people address Jesus as “Lord.” This title testifies to the respect and 
trust of those who approach him for help and healing.^ At the prompting of the Holy Spirit, 
“Lord” expresses the recognition of the divine mystery of Jesus.^ in the encounter with the risen 
Jesus, this title becomes adoration: “My Lord and my God!” It thus takes on a connotation of love 
and affection that remains proper to the Christian tradition: “It is the Lord!”§4 1 208 . 683 . 641 1 

449 By attributing to Jesus the divine title “Lord,” the first confessions of the Church’s faith affirm 
from the beginning that the power, honor, and glory due to God the Father are due also to Jesus, 
because “he was in the form of God , ”^2 and the Father manifested the sovereignty of Jesus by 
raising him from the dead and exalting him into his glory.^ 1 461 . 653) 

450 From the beginning of Christian history, the assertion of Christ’s lordship over the world and 
over history has implicitly recognized that man should not submit his personal freedom in an 
absolute manner to any earthly power, but only to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Caesar 
is not “the Lord.”^ “The Church... believes that the key, the center, and the purpose of the whole 
of man’s history is to be found in its Lord and Master. ( 668-672 . 2242) 

451 Christian prayer is characterized by the title “Lord,” whether in the invitation to prayer (“The 
Lord be with you.”), its conclusion (“through Christ our Lord”), or the exclamation full of trust and 
hope: Maran atha (“Our Lord, come!”), or Marana tha (“Come, Lord!”) — “Amen. Come, Lord 
Jesus !”h9 ( 2664-2665 . 2817 1 


IN BRIEF 















452 The name Jesus means “God saves.” The child bom of the Virgin Mary is called Jesus, “for he 
will save his people from their sins” (Mt 1:21): “there is no other name under heaven given among 
men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). 

453 The title “Christ” means “Anointed One” (Messiah). Jesus is the Christ, for “God anointed 
Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power” (Acts 10:38). He was the one “who is to 
come” (Lk 7:19), the object of “the hope of Israel” (Acts 28:20). 

454 The title “Son of God” signifies the unique and eternal relationship of Jesus Christ to God his 
Father: he is the only Son of the Father (cf. Jn 1:14,18; 3:16,18); he is God himself (cf. Jn 1:1). To 
be a Christian, one must believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (cf. Acts 8:37; 1 Jn 2:23). 

455 The title “Lord” indicates divine sovereignty. To confess or invoke Jesus as Lord is to believe 
in his divinity. “No one can say 'Jesus is Lord’ except by the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor 12:3). 


ARTICLE 3 

“HE WAS CONCEIVED BY THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, AND WAS BORN OF 
THE VIRGIN MARY” 


Paragraph 1. The Son of God Became Man 
I. Why Did the Word Become Flesh? 


456 With the Nicene Creed, we answer by confessing: “For us men and for our salvation he came 
down from heaven; by the power of the Holy Spirit, he became incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and 
was made man.” 

457 The Word became flesh for us in order to save us by reconciling us with God, who “loved us 
and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins”: “the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the 
world,” and “he was revealed to take away sins”:^ (607, 385) 

Sick, our nature demanded to be healed; fallen, to be raised up; dead, to rise again. We had 
lost the possession of the good; it was necessary for it to be given back to us. Closed in the 
darkness, it was necessary to bring us the light; captives, we awaited a Savior; prisoners, help; 
slaves, a liberator. Are these things minor or insignificant? Did they not move God to descend 
to human nature and visit it, since humanity was in so miserable and unhappy a state?LL 










458 The Word became flesh so that thus we might know God’s love: “In this the love of God was 
made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through 
him.” 2 “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him 
should not perish but have eternal life. ”23 (219) 

459 The Word became flesh to be our model of holiness: “Take my yoke upon you, and learn from 
me.” “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me. ”24 On the 
mountain of the Transfiguration, the Father commands: “Listen to him! ”22 Jesus is the model for 
the Beatitudes and the norm of the new law: “Love one another as I have loved you.”22 This love 
implies an effective offering of oneself, after his example. 22 (520, 823 . 2012 . 1717 . 1965 1 

460 The Word became flesh to make us “partakers of the divine nature”:^ “For this is why the 
Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into 
communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.” 2 “For 
the Son of God became man so that we might become God.”2Q “The only-begotten Son of God, 
wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make 
men gods.”21 (1265 . 1391 . 1988 1 

II. The Incarnation 


461 Taking up St. John’s expression, “The Word became flesh, ”22 the Church calls “Incarnation” 
the fact that the Son of God assumed a human nature in order to accomplish our salvation in it. In a 
hymn cited by St. Paul, the Church sings the mystery of the Incarnation: ( 653 . 661 . 449 1 

Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the 
form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, 
taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human 
form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.23 

462 The Letter to the Hebrews refers to the same mystery: 

Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, “Sacrifices and offerings you have 
not desired, but a body have you prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you 
have taken no pleasure. Then I said, ‘Lo, I have come to do your will, O God. ’”24 

463 Belief in the true Incarnation of the Son of God is the distinctive sign of Christian faith: “By 
this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh 














is of God.”^2 Such is the joyous conviction of the Church from her beginning whenever she sings 
“the mystery of our religion”: “He was manifested in the flesh. (90) 

III. True God and True Man 


464 The unique and altogether singular event of the Incarnation of the Son of God does not mean 
that Jesus Christ is part God and part man, nor does it imply that he is the result of a confused 
mixture of the divine and the human. He became truly man while remaining truly God. Jesus Christ 
is true God and true man. During the first centuries, the Church had to defend and clarify this truth 
of faith against the heresies that falsified it. (88) 

465 The first heresies denied not so much Christ’s divinity as his true humanity (Gnostic 
Docetism). From apostolic times the Christian faith has insisted on the true incarnation of God’s 
Son “come in the flesh.”£Z But already in the third century, the Church in a council at Antioch had 
to affirm against Paul of Samosata that Jesus Christ is Son of God by nature and not by adoption. 
The first ecumenical council of Nicaea in 325 confessed in its Creed that the Son of God is 
“begotten, not made, of the same substance ( homoousios ) as the Father,” and condemned Arius, 
who had affirmed that the Son of God “came to be from things that were not” and that he was 
“from another substance” than that of the Father.^ ( 242 ) 

466 The Nestorian heresy regarded Christ as a human person joined to the divine person of God’s 
Son. Opposing this heresy, St. Cyril of Alexandria and the third ecumenical council at Ephesus in 
431 confessed “that the Word, uniting to himself in his person the flesh animated by a rational soul, 
became man.”^ Christ’s humanity has no other subject than the divine person of the Son of God, 
who assumed it and made it his own, from his conception. For this reason the Council of Ephesus 
proclaimed in 431 that Mary truly became the Mother of God by the human conception of the Son 
of God in her womb: “Mother of God, not that the nature of the Word or his divinity received the 
beginning of its existence from the holy Virgin, but that, since the holy body, animated by a 
rational soul, which the Word of God united to himself according to the hypostasis, was born from 
her, the Word is said to be born according to the flesh.”2Q ( 495 ) 

467 The Monophysites affirmed that the human nature had ceased to exist as such in Christ when 
the divine person of God’s Son assumed it. Faced with this heresy, the fourth ecumenical council, 
at Chalcedon in 451, confessed: 


Following the holy Fathers, we unanimously teach and confess one and the same Son, our 




Lord Jesus Christ: the same perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, the same truly God 
and truly man, composed of rational soul and body; consubstantial with the Father as to his 
divinity and consubstantial with us as to his humanity; “like us in all things but sin.” He was 
begotten from the Father before all ages as to his divinity and in these last days, for us and for 
our salvation, was born as to his humanity of the virgin Mary, the Mother of God.— 

We confess that one and the same Christ, Lord, and only-begotten Son, is to be acknowledged 
in two natures without confusion, change, division, or separation. The distinction between the 
natures was never abolished by their union, but rather the character proper to each of the two 
natures was preserved as they came together in one person (prosopon ) and one hypostasis. 22 

468 After the Council of Chalcedon, some made of Christ’s human nature a kind of personal 
subject. Against them, the fifth ecumenical council at Constantinople in 553 confessed that “there is 
but one hypostasis [or person], which is our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the Trinity.”23 Thus 
everything in Christ’s human nature is to be attributed to his divine person as its proper subject, not 
only his miracles but also his sufferings and even his death: “He who was crucified in the flesh, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, is true God, Lord of glory, and one of the Holy Trinity .”24 [ 254 . 616 1 

469 The Church thus confesses that Jesus is inseparably true God and true man. He is truly the Son 
of God who, without ceasing to be God and Lord, became a man and our brother: [ 212 1 

“What he was, he remained and what he was not, he assumed,” sings the Roman Liturgy .22 
And the liturgy of St. John Chrysostom proclaims and sings: “O only-begotten Son and Word 
of God, immortal being, you who deigned for our salvation to become incarnate of the holy 
Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, you who without change became man and were 
crucified, O Christ our God, you who by your death have crushed death, you who are one of 
the Holy Trinity, glorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit, save us! ”22 

IV. How Is the Son of God Man? 


470 Because “human nature was assumed, not absorbed, ”22 in the mysterious union of the 
Incarnation, the Church was led over the course of centuries to confess the full reality of Christ’s 
human soul, with its operations of intellect and will, and of his human body. In parallel fashion, she 
had to recall on each occasion that Christ’s human nature belongs, as his own, to the divine person 
of the Son of God, who assumed it. Everything that Christ is and does in this nature derives from 
“one of the Trinity.” The Son of God therefore communicates to his humanity his own personal 





mode of existence in the Trinity. In his soul as in his body, Christ thus expresses humanly the 
divine ways of the Trinity:^ (516 . 626 . 2599 1 


The Son of God... worked with human hands; he thought with a human mind. He acted with a 
human will, and with a human heart he loved. Born of the Virgin Mary, he has truly been 
made one of us, like to us in all things except sin.22 

Christ’s soul and his human knowledge 

471 Apollinarius of Laodicaea asserted that in Christ the divine Word had replaced the soul or 
spirit. Against this error the Church confessed that the eternal Son also assumed a rational, human 
soul.122 (363) 

472 This human soul that the Son of God assumed is endowed with a true human knowledge. As 
such, this knowledge could not in itself be unlimited: it was exercised in the historical conditions of 
his existence in space and time. This is why the Son of God could, when he became man, “increase 
in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and man, ”121 and would even have to inquire for 
himself about what one in the human condition can learn only from experience.122 This 
corresponded to the reality of his voluntary emptying of himself, taking “the form of a slave. ”123 

473 But at the same time, this truly human knowledge of God’s Son expressed the divine life of his 
person.124 “The human nature of God’s Son, not by itself but by its union with the Word, knew and 
showed forth in itself everything that pertains to God. ”125 Such is first of all the case with the 
intimate and immediate knowledge that the Son of God made man has of his Father.122 The Son in 
his human knowledge also showed the divine penetration he had into the secret thoughts of human 
hearts .122 (240) 

474 By its union to the divine wisdom in the person of the Word incarnate, Christ enjoyed in his 
human knowledge the fullness of understanding of the eternal plans he had come to re veal. 122 
What he admitted to not knowing in this area, he elsewhere declared himself not sent to reveal. 122 

Christ’s human will 

475 Similarly, at the sixth ecumenical council, Constantinople III in 681, the Church confessed that 
Christ possesses two wills and two natural operations, divine and human. They are not opposed to 
each other, but cooperate in such a way that the Word made flesh willed humanly in obedience to 
his Father all that he had decided divinely with the Father and the Holy Spirit for our salvation.U2 







Christ’s human will “does not resist or oppose but rather submits to his divine and almighty 
will (2008 . 2824 1 


Christ’s true body 

476 Since the Word became flesh in assuming a true humanity, Christ’s body was finite.!!! 
Therefore the human face of Jesus can be portrayed; at the seventh ecumenical council (Nicaea II in 
787) the Church recognized its representation in holy images to be legitimate.!!! ( 1159-1162 . 
2129-2132 1 

477 At the same time the Church has always acknowledged that in the body of Jesus “we see our 
God made visible and so are caught up in love of the God we cannot see.”U4 The individual 
characteristics of Christ’s body express the divine person of God’s Son. He has made the features 
of his human body his own, to the point that they can be venerated when portrayed in a holy image, 
for the believer “who venerates the icon is venerating in it the person of the one depicted.”!!! 

The heart of the Incarnate Word 

478 Jesus knew and loved us each and all during his life, his agony, and his Passion and gave 
himself up for each one of us: “The Son of God... loved me and gave himself for me.”!!! He has 
loved us all with a human heart. For this reason, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, pierced by our sins and 
for our salvation,!!! “is quite rightly considered the chief sign and symbol of that... love with 
which the divine Redeemer continually loves the eternal Father and all human beings” without 
exception.!!! (487, 368, 2669, 766) 


IN BRIEF 


479 At the time appointed by God, the only Son of the Father, the eternal Word, that is, the Word 
and substantial Image of the Father, became incarnate; without losing his divine nature he has 
assumed human nature. 

480 Jesus Christ is true God and true man, in the unity of his divine person; for this reason he is the 
one and only mediator between God and men. 

481 Jesus Christ possesses two natures, one divine and the other human, not confused, but united in 
the one person of God’s Son. 












482 Christ, being true God and true man, has a human intellect and will, perfectly attuned and 
subject to his divine intellect and divine will, which he has in common with the Father and the Holy 
Spirit. 

483 The Incarnation is therefore the mystery of the wonderful union of the divine and human 
natures in the one person of the Word.

Paragraph 2. “Conceived by the Power of the Holy Spirit and Born of the Virgin Mary” 

I. Conceived by the Power of the Holy Spirit... 


484 The Annunciation to Mary inaugurates “the fullness of time,”H2 the time of the fulfillment of 
God’s promises and preparations. Mary was invited to conceive him in whom the “whole fullness 
of deity” would dwell “bodily.”^ The divine response to her question, “How can this be, since I 
know not man?” was given by the power of the Spirit: “The Holy Spirit will come upon you.”— 

(461, Z21) 

485 The mission of the Holy Spirit is always conjoined and ordered to that of the Son.222 The Holy 
Spirit, “the Lord, the giver of Life,” is sent to sanctify the womb of the Virgin Mary and divinely 
fecundate it, causing her to conceive the eternal Son of the Father in a humanity drawn from her 
own. (689, 723 1 

486 The Father’s only Son, conceived as man in the womb of the Virgin Mary, is “Christ,” that is 
to say, anointed by the Holy Spirit, from the beginning of his human existence, though the 
manifestation of this fact takes place only progressively: to the shepherds, to the magi, to John the 
Baptist, to the disciples.223 Thus the whole life of Jesus Christ will make manifest “how God 
anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power.”124 (437) 

II. ...Born of the Virgin Mary 

487 What the Catholic faith believes about Mary is based on what it believes about Christ, and 
what it teaches about Mary illumines in turn its faith in Christ. (963) 

Mary’s predestination 

488 “God sent forth his Son,” but to prepare a body for him, 12^ he wanted the free cooperation of a 
creature. For this, from all eternity God chose for the mother of his Son a daughter of Israel, a 
young Jewish woman of Nazareth in Galilee, “a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, 








of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary”;123 

The Father of mercies willed that the Incarnation should be preceded by assent on the part of 
the predestined mother, so that just as a woman had a share in the coming of death, so also 
should a woman contribute to the coming of life.l^Z 

489 Throughout the Old Covenant the mission of many holy women prepared for that of Mary. At 
the very beginning there was Eve; despite her disobedience, she receives the promise of a posterity 
that will be victorious over the evil one, as well as the promise that she will be the mother of all the 
living.123 By virtue of this promise, Sarah conceives a son in spite of her old age.122 Against all 
human expectation God chooses those who were considered powerless and weak to show forth his 
faithfulness to his promises: Hannah, the mother of Samuel; Deborah; Ruth; Judith and Esther; and 
many other women.132 Mary “stands out among the poor and humble of the Lord, who confidently 
hope for and receive salvation from him. After a long period of waiting the times are fulfilled in 
her, the exalted Daughter of Sion, and the new plan of salvation is established.”^ (72 2, 410, 145 . 
64) 

The Immaculate Conception 

490 To become the mother of the Savior, Mary “was enriched by God with gifts appropriate to such 
a role. ”1^ The angel Gabriel at the moment of the annunciation salutes her as “full of grace. ”133 In 
fact, in order for Mary to be able to give the free assent of her faith to the announcement of her 
vocation, it was necessary that she be wholly borne by God’s grace. ( 2676 . 2853 . 2001 1 

491 Through the centuries the Church has become ever more aware that Mary, “full of grace” 
through God, 133 was redeemed from the moment of her conception. That is what the dogma of the 
Immaculate Conception confesses, as Pope Pius IX proclaimed in 1854: 1 411 1 

The most Blessed Virgin Mary was, from the first moment of her conception, by a singular 
grace and privilege of almighty God and by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, Savior of the 
human race, preserved immune from all stain of original sin.132 

492 The “splendor of an entirely unique holiness” by which Mary is “enriched from the first instant 
of her conception” comes wholly from Christ: she is “redeemed, in a more exalted fashion, by 
reason of the merits of her Son.”!33 The Father blessed Mary more than any other created person 
“in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places” and chose her “in Christ before the 
foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless before him in love. ”133 ( 2011 . 1077 1 











493 The Fathers of the Eastern tradition call the Mother of God “the All-Holy” ( Panagia ) and 
celebrate her as “free from any stain of sin, as though fashioned by the Holy Spirit and formed as a 
new creature. ”142 By the grace of God Mary remained free of every personal sin her whole life 
long. 

“Let it be done to me according to your word... ” 

494 At the announcement that she would give birth to “the Son of the Most High” without knowing 
man, by the power of the Holy Spirit, Mary responded with the obedience of faith, certain that 
“with God nothing will be impossible”: “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be [done] to 
me according to your word.”142 Thus, giving her consent to God’s word, Mary becomes the mother 
of Jesus. Espousing the divine will for salvation wholeheartedly, without a single sin to restrain her, 
she gave herself entirely to the person and to the work of her Son; she did so in order to serve the 
mystery of redemption with him and dependent on him, by God’s grace :142 [ 2617 . 148 . 968 . 726) 

As St. Irenaeus says, “Being obedient she became the cause of salvation for herself and for the 
whole human race. ”141 Hence not a few of the early Fathers gladly assert... : “The knot of 
Eve’s disobedience was untied by Mary’s obedience: what the virgin Eve bound through her 
disbelief, Mary loosened by her faith.”142 Comparing her with Eve, they call Mary “the 
Mother of the living” and frequently claim: “Death through Eve, life through Mary. ”144 

Mary’s divine motherhood 

495 Called in the Gospels “the mother of Jesus,” Mary is acclaimed by Elizabeth, at the prompting 
of the Spirit and even before the birth of her son, as “the mother of my Lord. ”144 In fact, the One 
whom she conceived as man by the Holy Spirit, who truly became her Son according to the flesh, 
was none other than the Father’s eternal Son, the second person of the Holy Trinity. Hence the 
Church confesses that Mary is truly “Mother of God” (Theotokos). 144 (466, 2677 ) 

Mary’s virginity 

496 From the first formulations of her faith, the Church has confessed that Jesus was conceived 
solely by the power of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary, affirming also the corporeal 
aspect of this event: Jesus was conceived “by the Holy Spirit without human seed.”14§ The Fathers 
see in the virginal conception the sign that it truly was the Son of God who came in a humanity like 
our own. Thus St. Ignatius of Antioch at the beginning of the second century says: 








You are firmly convinced about our Lord, who is truly of the race of David according to the 
flesh, Son of God according to the will and power of God, truly born of a virgin,... he was 
truly nailed to a tree for us in his flesh under Pontius Pilate... he truly suffered, as he is also 
truly risen.i^ 

497 The gospel accounts understand the virginal conception of Jesus as a divine work that 
surpasses all human understanding and possibility:^ “That which is conceived in her is of the 
Holy Spirit,” said the angel to Joseph about Mary his fiancee.142 The Church sees here the 
fulfillment of the divine promise given through the prophet Isaiah: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive 
and bear a son.”l^ 

498 People are sometimes troubled by the silence of St. Mark’s Gospel and the New Testament 
Epistles about Jesus’ virginal conception. Some might wonder if we were merely dealing with 
legends or theological constructs not claiming to be history. To this we must respond: Faith in the 
virginal conception of Jesus met with the lively opposition, mockery, or incomprehension of non¬ 
believers, Jews and pagans alike;!^! so it could hardly have been motivated by pagan mythology or 
by some adaptation to the ideas of the age. The meaning of this event is accessible only to faith, 
which understands in it the “connection of these mysteries with one another”!^ i n the totality of 
Christ’s mysteries, from his Incarnation to his Passover. St. Ignatius of Antioch already bears 
witness to this connection: “Mary’s virginity and giving birth, and even the Lord’s death escaped 
the notice of the prince of this world: these three mysteries worthy of proclamation were 
accomplished in God’s silence.”!^ (90, 2717 1 

Mary — “ ever-virgin” 

499 The deepening of faith in the virginal motherhood led the Church to confess Mary’s real and 
perpetual virginity even in the act of giving birth to the Son of God made man.1^4 j n fact, Christ’s 
birth “did not diminish his mother’s virginal integrity but sanctified it.”!^5 And so the liturgy of the 
Church celebrates Mary as Aeiparthenos, the “Ever-virgin.”!^ 

500 Against this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the Bible mentions brothers and 
sisters of Jesus.l^Z The Church has always understood these passages as not referring to other 
children of the Virgin Mary. In fact James and Joseph, “brothers of Jesus,” are the sons of another 
Mary, a disciple of Christ, whom St. Matthew significantly calls “the other Mary.”!^ They are 
close relations of Jesus, according to an Old Testament expression.!^ 


501 Jesus is Mary’s only son, but her spiritual motherhood extends to all men whom indeed he 



came to save: “The Son whom she brought forth is he whom God placed as the first-born among 
many brethren, that is, the faithful in whose generation and formulation she cooperates with a 
mother’s love.”l^ ( 969 . 970) 

Mary’s virginal motherhood in God’s plan 

502 The eyes of faith can discover in the context of the whole of Revelation the mysterious reasons 
why God in his saving plan wanted his Son to be born of a virgin. These reasons touch both on the 
person of Christ and his redemptive mission, and on the welcome Mary gave that mission on behalf 
of all men. (90) 

503 Mary’s virginity manifests God’s absolute initiative in the Incarnation. Jesus has only God as 
Father. “He was never estranged from the Father because of the human nature which he assumed.... 
He is naturally Son of the Father as to his divinity and naturally son of his mother as to his 
humanity, but properly Son of the Father in both natures. ”1^1 ( 422 ) 

504 Jesus is conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary’s womb because he is the New Adam, 
who inaugurates the new creation: “The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second 
man is from heaven.”lh2 From his conception, Christ’s humanity is filled with the Holy Spirit, for 
God “gives him the Spirit without measure.”!^ From “his fullness” as the head of redeemed 
humanity “we have all received, grace upon grace. ”1^1 (359) 

505 By his virginal conception, Jesus, the New Adam, ushers in the new birth of children adopted 
in the Holy Spirit through faith. “How can this be?”l^ Participation in the divine life arises “not of 
blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.”l^ The acceptance of this life 
is virginal because it is entirely the Spirit’s gift to man. The spousal character of the human 
vocation in relation to Godl^ is fulfilled perfectly in Mary’s virginal motherhood. (1265) 

506 Mary is a virgin because her virginity is the sign of her faith “unadulterated by any doubt,” and 
of her undivided gift of herself to God’s will.i^ It is her faith that enables her to become the 
mother of the Savior: “Mary is more blessed because she embraces faith in Christ than because she 
conceives the flesh of Christ.”lh9 ( 148 . 1814 1 

507 At once virgin and mother, Mary is the symbol and the most perfect realization of the Church: 
“the Church indeed... by receiving the word of God in faith becomes herself a mother. By 
preaching and Baptism she brings forth sons, who are conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of 
God, to a new and immortal life. She herself is a virgin, who keeps in its entirety and purity the 









faith she pledged to her spouse. ”121 (967, 149 ) 


IN BRIEF 


508 From among the descendants of Eve, God chose the Virgin Mary to be the mother of his Son. 
“Full of grace,” Mary is “the most excellent fruit of redemption” (SC 103): from the first instant of 
her conception, she was totally preserved from the stain of original sin and she remained pure from 
all personal sin throughout her life. 

509 Mary is truly “Mother of God” since she is the mother of the eternal Son of God made man, 
who is God himself. 

510 Mary “remained a virgin in conceiving her Son, a virgin in giving birth to him, a virgin in 
carrying him, a virgin in nursing him at her breast, always a virgin” (St. Augustine, Serm. 186, 1: 
PL 38, 999): with her whole being she is “the handmaid of the Lord” (Lk 1:38). 

511 The Virgin Mary “cooperated through free faith and obedience in human salvation” (LG 56). 
She uttered her yes “in the name of all human nature” (St. Thomas Aquinas, STh III, 30, 1). By her 
obedience she became the new Eve, mother of the living.

Paragraph 3. The Mysteries of Christ’s Life 

512 Concerning Christ’s life the Creed speaks only about the mysteries of the Incarnation 
(conception and birth) and Paschal mystery (passion, crucifixion, death, burial, descent into hell, 
resurrection, and ascension). It says nothing explicitly about the mysteries of Jesus’ hidden or 
public life, but the articles of faith concerning his Incarnation and Passover do shed light on the 
whole of his earthly life. “All that Jesus did and taught, from the beginning until the day when he 
was taken up to heaven, ”±21 is to be seen in the light of the mysteries of Christmas and Easter. 
(1163) 

513 According to circumstances catechesis will make use of all the richness of the mysteries of 
Jesus. Here it is enough merely to indicate some elements common to all the mysteries of Christ’s 
life (I), in order then to sketch the principal mysteries of Jesus’ hidden (II) and public (III) life. 
1 426 . 561 1 

I. Christ’s Whole Life Is Mystery 


514 Many things about Jesus of interest to human curiosity do not figure in the Gospels. Almost 
nothing is said about his hidden life at Nazareth, and even a great part of his public life is not 
recounted.±22 What is written in the Gospels was set down there “so that you may believe that 
Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name. ”±23 

515 The Gospels were written by men who were among the first to have the faith±2± and wanted to 
share it with others. Having known in faith who Jesus is, they could see and make others see the 
traces of his mystery in all his earthly life. From the swaddling clothes of his birth to the vinegar of 





his Passion and the shroud of his Resurrection, everything in Jesus’ life was a sign of his 
mystery .125 pg s deeds, miracles, and words all revealed that “in him the whole fullness of deity 
dwells bodily.”12b His humanity appeared as “sacrament,” that is, the sign and instrument, of his 
divinity and of the salvation he brings: what was visible in his earthly life leads to the invisible 
mystery of his divine sonship and redemptive mission. ( 126 . 609 . 774 . 477) 

Characteristics common to Jesus’ mysteries 

516 Christ’s whole earthly life—his words and deeds, his silences and sufferings, indeed his 

manner of being and speaking—is Revelation of the Father. Jesus can say: “Whoever has seen me 
has seen the Father,” and the Father can say: “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!”!22 
Because our Lord became man in order to do his Father’s will, even the least characteristics of his 
mysteries manifest “God’s love... among us. ”128 2708 1 

517 Christ’s whole life is a mystery of redemption. Redemption comes to us above all through the 
blood of his cross,122 but this mystery is at work throughout Christ’s entire life: (606, 1115 1 

—already in his Incarnation through which by becoming poor he enriches us with his 
poverty;!^ 

—in his hidden life which by his submission atones for our disobedience;!^! 

—in his word which purifies its hearers;!^ 

—in his healings and exorcisms by which “he took our infirmities and bore our diseases”;!^ 

—and in his Resurrection by which he justifies us .1^4 

518 Christ’s whole life is a mystery of recapitulation. All Jesus did, said, and suffered had for its 
aim restoring fallen man to his original vocation: ( 668 . 2748 1 

When Christ became incarnate and was made man, he recapitulated in himself the long history 
of mankind and procured for us a 'short cut’ to salvation, so that what we had lost in Adam, 
that is, being in the image and likeness of God, we might recover in Christ Jesus.!^ For this 
reason Christ experienced all the stages of life, thereby giving communion with God to all 
men.!^ 


Our communion in the mysteries of Jesus 

519 All Christ’s riches “are for every individual and are everybody’s property.”!^! Christ did not 
live his life for himself but for us, from his Incarnation “for us men and for our salvation” to his 












death “for our sins” and Resurrection “for our justification.”!^ He is still “our advocate with the 
Father,” who “always lives to make intercession” for us. 1^2 He remains ever “in the presence of 
God on our behalf, bringing before him all that he lived and suffered for us. ”1^0 ( 793 . 602 . 1085 1 

520 In all of his life Jesus presents himself as our model. He is “the perfect man,”l^lwho invites us 
to become his disciples and follow him. In humbling himself, he has given us an example to 
imitate, through his prayer he draws us to pray, and by his poverty he calls us to accept freely the 
privation and persecutions that may come our way.!^ (459, 359, 2607 1 

521 Christ enables us to live in him all that he himself lived, and he lives it in us. “By his 
Incarnation, he, the Son of God, has in a certain way united himself with each man.”!^! We are 
called only to become one with him, for he enables us as the members of his Body to share in what 
he lived for us in his flesh as our model: ( 2715 . 1391 1 

We must continue to accomplish in ourselves the stages of Jesus’ life and his mysteries and 
often to beg him to perfect and realize them in us and in his whole Church.... For it is the plan 
of the Son of God to make us and the whole Church partake in his mysteries and to extend 
them to and continue them in us and in his whole Church. This is his plan for fulfilling his 
mysteries in us.l^! 

II. The Mysteries of Jesus’ Infancy and Hidden Life 


The preparations 

522 The coming of God’s Son to earth is an event of such immensity that God willed to prepare for 
it over centuries. He makes everything converge on Christ: all the rituals and sacrifices, figures and 
symbols of the “First Covenant.”!^ He announces him through the mouths of the prophets who 
succeeded one another in Israel. Moreover, he awakens in the hearts of the pagans a dim 
expectation of this coming. ( 711 . 762 1 

523 St. John the Baptist is the Lord’s immediate precursor or forerunner, sent to prepare his 
way.l^h “Prophet of the Most High,” John surpasses all the prophets, of whom he is the last.l^Z He 
inaugurates the Gospel, already from his mother’s womb welcomes the coming of Christ, and 
rejoices in being “the friend of the bridegroom,” whom he points out as “the Lamb of God, who 
takes away the sin of the world.”!^ Going before Jesus “in the spirit and power of Elijah,” John 
bears witness to Christ in his preaching, by his Baptism of conversion, and through his 












martyrdom. 222 (717-720 1 


524 When the Church celebrates the liturgy of Advent each year, she makes present this ancient 
expectancy of the Messiah, for by sharing in the long preparation for the Savior’s first coming, the 
faithful renew their ardent desire for his second coming.222 By celebrating the precursor’s birth and 
martyrdom, the Church unites herself to his desire: “He must increase, but I must decrease. ”221 
( 1171 ) 

The Christmas mystery 

525 Jesus was born in a humble stable, into a poor family.222 Simple shepherds were the first 
witnesses to this event. In this poverty heaven’s glory was made manifest.223 The Church never 
tires of singing the glory of this night: (437, 2443 1 

The Virgin today brings into the world the Eternal 
And the earth offers a cave to the Inaccessible. 

The angels and shepherds praise him 
And the magi advance with the star, 

For you are born for us, 

Little Child, God eternal! 224 

526 To become a child in relation to God is the condition for entering the kingdom. 225 For this, we 
must humble ourselves and become little. Even more: to become “children of God” we must be 
“born from above” or “born of God.”222 Only when Christ is formed in us will the mystery of 
Christmas be fulfilled in us.22Z Christmas is the mystery of this “marvelous exchange”: ( 460 ) 

O marvelous exchange! Man’s Creator has become man, born of the Virgin. We have been 
made sharers in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share our humanity.222 

The mysteries of Jesus’ infancy 

527 Jesus’ circumcision, on the eighth day after his birth,222 [ s the sign of his incorporation into 
Abraham’s descendants, into the people of the covenant. It is the sign of his submission to the 
Law212 and his deputation to Israel’s worship, in which he will participate throughout his life. This 
sign prefigures that “circumcision of Christ” which is Baptism.2U ( 580 . 1214 ) 


528 The Epiphany is the manifestation of Jesus as Messiah of Israel, Son of God and Savior of the 









world. The great feast of Epiphany celebrates the adoration of Jesus by the wise men (magi) from 
the East, together with his baptism in the Jordan and the wedding feast at Cana in Galilee.212 i n the 
magi, representatives of the neighboring pagan religions, the Gospel sees the first-fruits of the 
nations, who welcome the good news of salvation through the Incarnation. The magi’s coming to 
Jerusalem in order to pay homage to the king of the Jews shows that they seek in Israel, in the 
messianic light of the star of David, the one who will be king of the nations.212 Their coming 
means that pagans can discover Jesus and worship him as Son of God and Savior of the world only 
by turning toward the Jews and receiving from them the messianic promise as contained in the Old 
Testament. 214 The Epiphany shows that “the full number of the nations” now takes its “place in the 
family of the patriarchs,” and acquires Israelitica dignitas 215 (are made “worthy of the heritage of 
Israel”). (439, 711-716 . 122) 

529 The presentation of Jesus in the temple shows him to be the firstborn Son who belongs to the 
Lord.21b With Simeon and Anna, all Israel awaits its encounter with the Savior—the name given to 
this event in the Byzantine tradition. Jesus is recognized as the long-expected Messiah, the “light to 
the nations” and the “glory of Israel,” but also “a sign that is spoken against.” The sword of sorrow 
predicted for Mary announces Christ’s perfect and unique oblation on the cross that will impart the 
salvation God had “prepared in the presence of all peoples.” (583 . 439 . 614 1 

530 The flight into Egypt and the massacre of the innocents^ make manifest the opposition of 
darkness to the light: “He came to his own home, and his own people received him not.”215 
Christ’s whole life was lived under the sign of persecution. His own share it with him.219 Jesus’ 
departure from Egypt recalls the exodus and presents him as the definitive liberator of God’s 
people.22Q ( 574 1 

The mysteries of Jesus’ hidden life 

531 During the greater part of his life Jesus shared the condition of the vast majority of human 
beings: a daily life spent without evident greatness, a life of manual labor. His religious life was 
that of a Jew obedient to the law of God,221 a life in the community. From this whole period it is 
revealed to us that Jesus was “obedient” to his parents and that he “increased in wisdom and in 
stature, and in favor with God and man.”222 (2427 1 

532 Jesus’ obedience to his mother and legal father fulfills the fourth commandment perfectly and 
was the temporal image of his filial obedience to his Father in heaven. The everyday obedience of 
Jesus to Joseph and Mary both announced and anticipated the obedience of Holy Thursday: “Not 










my will.... The obedience of Christ in the daily routine of his hidden life was already 
inaugurating his work of restoring what the disobedience of Adam had destroyed.224 ( 2214-2220 . 
612 1 

533 The hidden life at Nazareth allows everyone to enter into fellowship with Jesus by the most 
ordinary events of daily life: (2712 . 2204 . 2427) 

The home of Nazareth is the school where we begin to understand the life of Jesus—the 
school of the Gospel. First, then, a lesson of silence. May esteem for silence, that admirable 
and indispensable condition of mind, revive in us... A lesson on family life. May Nazareth 
teach us what family life is, its communion of love, its austere and simple beauty, and its 
sacred and inviolable character... A lesson of work. Nazareth, home of the “Carpenter’s Son,” 
in you I would choose to understand and proclaim the severe and redeeming law of human 
work.... To conclude, I want to greet all the workers of the world, holding up to them their 
great pattern, their brother who is God.222 

534 The finding of Jesus in the temple is the only event that breaks the silence of the Gospels about 
the hidden years of Jesus .226 Here Jesus lets us catch a glimpse of the mystery of his total 
consecration to a mission that flows from his divine sonship: “Did you not know that I must be 
about my Father’s work?”22Z Mary and Joseph did not understand these words, but they accepted 
them in faith. Mary “kept all these things in her heart” during the years Jesus remained hidden in 
the silence of an ordinary life. (583 . 2599 . 964)

III. The Mysteries of Jesus’ Public Life 


The baptism of Jesus 

535 Jesus’ public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan.228 j 0 hn preaches “a baptism 
of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.”229 a crowd of sinners220 —tax collectors and soldiers, 
Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes—come to be baptized by him. “Then Jesus appears.” The 
Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and receives baptism. Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, 
comes upon Jesus and a voice from heaven proclaims, “This is my beloved Son.”221 This is the 
manifestation (“Epiphany”) of Jesus as Messiah of Israel and Son of God. 1 719-720 . 701 . 438 1 

536 The baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and inauguration of his mission as God’s 
suffering Servant. He allows himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already “the Lamb of 
God, who takes away the sin of the world.”222 Already he is anticipating the “baptism” of his 
bloody death.223 Already he is coming to “fulfill all righteousness,” that is, he is submitting himself 
entirely to his Father’s will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our 





sins. 224 The Father’s voice responds to the Son’s acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his 
Son.225 Thg Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to “rest on 
him.”236 j esus be the source of the Spirit for all mankind. At his baptism “the heavens were 
opened”22Z —the heavens that Adam’s sin had closed—and the waters were sanctified by the 
descent of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation. (606, 1224 . 444 . 727 . 739) 

537 Through Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimilated to Jesus, who in his own baptism 
anticipates his death and resurrection. The Christian must enter into this mystery of humble self- 
abasement and repentance, go down into the water with Jesus in order to rise with him, be reborn of 
water and the Spirit so as to become the Father’s beloved son in the Son and “walk in newness of 
lif e ” : 238 (1262, 628) 

Let us be buried with Christ by Baptism to rise with him; let us go down with him to be raised 
with him; and let us rise with him to be glorified with him.229 

Everything that happened to Christ lets us know that, after the bath of water, the Holy Spirit 
swoops down upon us from high heaven and that, adopted by the Father’s voice, we become 
sons of God.24Q 

Jesus ’ temptations 

538 The Gospels speak of a time of solitude for Jesus in the desert immediately after his baptism by 
John. Driven by the Spirit into the desert, Jesus remains there for forty days without eating; he lives 
among wild beasts, and angels minister to him.241 At the end of this time Satan tempts him three 
times, seeking to compromise his filial attitude toward God. Jesus rebuffs these attacks, which 
recapitulate the temptations of Adam in Paradise and of Israel in the desert, and the devil leaves 
him “until an opportune time. ”242 (394, 518 1 

539 The evangelists indicate the salvific meaning of this mysterious event: Jesus is the new Adam 
who remained faithful just where the first Adam had given in to temptation. Jesus fulfills Israel’s 
vocation perfectly: in contrast to those who had once provoked God during forty years in the desert, 
Christ reveals himself as God’s Servant, totally obedient to the divine will. In this, Jesus is the 
devil’s conqueror: he “binds the strong man” to take back his plunder.243 Jesus’ victory over the 
tempter in the desert anticipates victory at the Passion, the supreme act of obedience of his filial 
love for the Father. 1 397 . 385 . 609 1 


540 Jesus’ temptation reveals the way in which the Son of God is Messiah, contrary to the way 














Satan proposes to him and the way men wish to attribute to him.244 This is why Christ vanquished 
the Tempter for us: “For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our 
weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sinning.”245 By 
the solemn forty days of Lent the Church unites herself each year to the mystery of Jesus in the 
desert. 1 2119 . 519 . 2849 . 1438) 

“The Kingdom of God is at hand” 

541 “Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and 
saying: The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe in the 
gospel. ’”246 “To carry out the will of the Father Christ inaugurated the kingdom of heaven on 
earth.”24Z Now the Father’s will is “to raise up men to share in his own divine life. ”248 Be does this 
by gathering men around his Son Jesus Christ. This gathering is the Church, “on earth the seed and 
beginning of that kingdom.”242 1 2816 . 763 . 669 . 768 . 865 ) 

542 Christ stands at the heart of this gathering of men into the “family of God.” By his word, 
through signs that manifest the reign of God, and by sending out his disciples, Jesus calls all people 
to come together around him. But above all in the great Paschal mystery—his death on the cross 
and his Resurrection—he would accomplish the coming of his kingdom. “And I, when I am lifted 
up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.” Into this union with Christ all men are called.222

The proclamation of the Kingdom of God 

543 Everyone is called to enter the kingdom. First announced to the children of Israel, this 
messianic kingdom is intended to accept men of all nations.251 To enter it, one must first accept 
Jesus’ word: ( 764 ) 


The word of the Lord is compared to a seed which is sown in a field; those who hear it with 
faith and are numbered among the little flock of Christ have truly received the kingdom. Then, 



by its own power, the seed sprouts and grows until the harvest.^ 

544 The kingdom belongs to the poor and lowly, which means those who have accepted it with 
humble hearts. Jesus is sent to “preach good news to the poor”;^3 he declares them blessed, for 
“theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”^ To them—the “little ones” — the Father is pleased to reveal 
what remains hidden from the wise and the learned.^ Jesus shares the life of the poor, from the 
cradle to the cross; he experiences hunger, thirst, and privation.^ Jesus identifies himself with the 
poor of every kind and makes active love toward them the condition for entering his kingdom. 2TZ 
( 709 . 2443 . 2546 1 

545 Jesus invites sinners to the table of the kingdom: “I came not to call the righteous, but 
sinners.”^ He invites them to that conversion without which one cannot enter the kingdom, but 
shows them in word and deed his Father’s boundless mercy for them and the vast “joy in heaven 
over one sinner who repents.”^ The supreme proof of his love will be the sacrifice of his own life 
“for the forgiveness of sins.”2hQ (1443, 588, 1846 . 1439 1 

546 Jesus’ invitation to enter his kingdom comes in the form of parables, a characteristic feature of 
his teaching.^ Through his parables he invites people to the feast of the kingdom, but he also asks 
for a radical choice: to gain the kingdom, one must give everything.^ Words are not enough; 
deeds are required.-^ The parables are like mirrors for man: will he be hard soil or good earth for 
the word?^4 What use has he made of the talents he has received?^ Jesus and the presence of the 
kingdom in this world are secretly at the heart of the parables. One must enter the kingdom, that is, 
become a disciple of Christ, in order to “know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven.”^ For those 
who stay “outside,” everything remains enigmatic.^ 1 2613 . 542 1 

The signs of the Kingdom of God 

547 Jesus accompanies his words with many “mighty works and wonders and signs,” which 
manifest that the kingdom is present in him and attest that he was the promised Messiah.^ ( 670 . 
439 1 

548 The signs worked by Jesus attest that the Father has sent him. They invite belief in him.^ To 
those who turn to him in faith, he grants what they ask.^Q So miracles strengthen faith in the One 
who does his Father’s works; they bear witness that he is the Son of God.271 But his miracles can 
also be occasions for “offense”;^ they are not intended to satisfy people’s curiosity or desire for 
magic. Despite his evident miracles some people reject Jesus; he is even accused of acting by the 
power of demons.^ ( 156 . 2616 . 574 . 447 1 

















549 By freeing some individuals from the earthly evils of hunger, injustice, illness, and death, ^ 
Jesus performed messianic signs. Nevertheless he did not come to abolish all evils here below,^ 
but to free men from the gravest slavery, sin, which thwarts them in their vocation as God’s sons 
and causes all forms of human bondage.^ ( 1503 . 440) 

550 The coming of God’s kingdom means the defeat of Satan’s: “If it is by the Spirit of God that I 
cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.”^ Jesus’ exorcisms free some 
individuals from the domination of demons. They anticipate Jesus’ great victory over “the ruler of 
this world.”^ The kingdom of God will be definitively established through Christ’s cross: “God 
reigned from the wood.”^9 ( 394 . 1673 . 440 . 2816 1 

“The keys of the kingdom” 

551 From the beginning of his public life Jesus chose certain men, twelve in number, to be with 
him and to participate in his mission.^ He gives the Twelve a share in his authority and “sent 
them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal.”^l They remain associated for ever with 
Christ’s kingdom, for through them he directs the Church: (858, 765) 

As my Father appointed a kingdom for me, so do I appoint for you that you may eat and drink 
at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .^2 

552 Simon Peter holds the first place in the college of the Twelve;^ Jesus entrusted a unique 
mission to him. Through a revelation from the Father, Peter had confessed: “You are the Christ, the 
Son of the living God.” Our Lord then declared to him: “You are Peter, and on this rock I will build 
my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.”2M Christ, the “living stone , ”^2 thus 
assures his Church, built on Peter, of victory over the powers of death. Because of the faith he 
confessed Peter will remain the unshakeable rock of the Church. His mission will be to keep this 
faith from every lapse and to strengthen his brothers in it.^ ( 880 . 153 . 442 . 424 1 

553 Jesus entrusted a specific authority to Peter: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of 
heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth 
shall be loosed in heaven.”2Sl The “power of the keys” designates authority to govern the house of 
God, which is the Church. Jesus, the Good Shepherd, confirmed this mandate after his 
Resurrection: “Feed my sheep. The power to “bind and loose” connotes the authority to 
absolve sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgments, and to make disciplinary decisions in the Church. 
Jesus entrusted this authority to the Church through the ministry of the apostles^ and in particular 
through the ministry of Peter, the only one to whom he specifically entrusted the keys of the 














kingdom. (881, 1445, 641, 881) 


A foretaste of the Kingdom: the Transfiguration 

554 From the day Peter confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Master 
“began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things... and be killed, 
and on the third day be raised. ”222 p e ter scorns this prediction, nor do the others understand it any 
better than he.221 In this context the mysterious episode of Jesus’ Transfiguration takes place on a 
high mountain, 222 before three witnesses chosen by himself: Peter, James, and John. Jesus’ face 
and clothes become dazzling with light, and Moses and Elijah appear, speaking “of his departure, 
which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem.”223 a cloud covers him and a voice from heaven says: 
“This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him! ”224 (697, 2600 . 440) 

555 For a moment Jesus discloses his divine glory, confirming Peter’s confession. He also reveals 
that he will have to go by the way of the cross at Jerusalem in order to “enter into his glory. ”222 
Moses and Elijah had seen God’s glory on the Mountain; the Law and the Prophets had announced 
the Messiah’s sufferings .226 Christ’s Passion is the will of the Father: the Son acts as God’s 
servant;22Z the cloud indicates the presence of the Holy Spirit. “The whole Trinity appeared: the 
Father in the voice; the Son in the man; the Spirit in the shining cloud. ”226 ( 2576 . 2583 . 257) 

You were transfigured on the mountain, and your disciples, as much as they were capable of 
it, beheld your glory, O Christ our God, so that when they should see you crucified they would 
understand that your Passion was voluntary, and proclaim to the world that you truly are the 
splendor of the Father.222 

556 On the threshold of the public life: the baptism; on the threshold of the Passover: the 
Transfiguration. Jesus’ baptism proclaimed “the mystery of the first regeneration,” namely, our 
Baptism; the Transfiguration “is the sacrament of the second regeneration”: our own 
Resurrection.222 From now on we share in the Lord’s Resurrection through the Spirit who acts in 
the sacraments of the Body of Christ. The Transfiguration gives us a foretaste of Christ’s glorious 
coming, when he “will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body.”221 But it also recalls 
that “it is through many persecutions that we must enter the kingdom of God”;222 ( 1003 1 

Peter did not yet understand this when he wanted to remain with Christ on the mountain. It has 
been reserved for you, Peter, but for after death. For now, Jesus says: “Go down to toil on 
earth, to serve on earth, to be scorned and crucified on earth. Life goes down to be killed; 
Bread goes down to suffer hunger; the Way goes down to be exhausted on his journey; the 













Spring goes down to suffer thirst; and you refuse to suffer?”^

Jesus ’ ascent to Jerusalem 

557 “When the days drew near for him to be taken up [Jesus] set his face to go to Jerusalem.”224 
By this decision he indicated that he was going up to Jerusalem prepared to die there. Three times 
he had announced his Passion and Resurrection; now, heading toward Jerusalem, Jesus says: “It 
cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem.”225 

558 Jesus recalls the martyrdom of the prophets who had been put to death in Jerusalem. 
Nevertheless he persists in calling Jerusalem to gather around him: “How often would I have 


gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! 
When Jerusalem comes into view he weeps over her and expresses once again his heart’s desire: 
“Would that even today you knew the things that make for peace! But now they are hid from your 
eyes.”MZ 

Jesus’ messianic entrance into Jerusalem 

559 How will Jerusalem welcome her Messiah? Although Jesus had always refused popular 
attempts to make him king, he chooses the time and prepares the details for his messianic entry into 
the city of “his father David.”^ Acclaimed as son of David, as the one who brings salvation 
(Hosanna means “Save!” or “Give salvation!”), the “King of glory” enters his City “riding on an 
ass. ”^22 Jesus conquers the Daughter of Zion, a figure of his Church, neither by ruse nor by 
violence, but by the humility that bears witness to the truth.^ And so the subjects of his kingdom 
on that day are children and God’s poor, who acclaim him as had the angels when they announced 
him to the shepherds.^ Their acclamation, “Blessed be he who comes in the name of the 
LORD,is taken up by the Church in the “Sanctus” of the Eucharistic liturgy that introduces the 
memorial of the Lord’s Passover. (333, 1352 1 

560 Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem manifested the coming of the kingdom that the King-Messiah was 
going to accomplish by the Passover of his Death and Resurrection. It is with the celebration of that 
entry on Palm Sunday that the Church’s liturgy solemnly opens Holy Week. (550, 2816 1 


IN BRIEF 


561 “The whole of Christ’s life was a continual teaching: his silences, his miracles, his gestures, his 
prayer, his love for people, his special affection for the little and the poor, his acceptance of the 
total sacrifice on the Cross for the redemption of the world, and his Resurrection are the 
actualization of his word and the fulfillment of Revelation” (John Paul II, CT 9). 

562 Christ’s disciples are to conform themselves to him until he is formed in them (cf. Gal 4:19). 
“For this reason we, who have been made like to him, who have died with him and risen with him, 
are taken up into the mysteries of his life, until we reign together with him” (LG 7 § 4). 

563 No one, whether shepherd or wise man, can approach God here below except by kneeling 
before the manger at Bethlehem and adoring him hidden in the weakness of a new-born child. 








564 By his obedience to Mary and Joseph, as well as by his humble work during the long years in 
Nazareth, Jesus gives us the example of holiness in the daily life of family and work. 

565 From the beginning of his public life, at his baptism, Jesus is the “Servant,” wholly consecrated 
to the redemptive work that he will accomplish by the “baptism” of his Passion. 

566 The temptation in the desert shows Jesus, the humble Messiah, who triumphs over Satan by his 
total adherence to the plan of salvation willed by the Father. 

567 The Kingdom of heaven was inaugurated on earth by Christ. “This kingdom shone out before 
men in the word, in the works, and in the presence of Christ” (LG 5). The Church is the seed and 
beginning of this kingdom. Her keys are entrusted to Peter. 

568 Christ’s Transfiguration aims at strengthening the apostles’ faith in anticipation of his Passion: 
the ascent onto the “high mountain” prepares for the ascent to Calvary. Christ, Head of the Church, 
manifests what his Body contains and radiates in the sacraments: “the hope of glory” (Co/ 1:27; cf. 
St. Leo the Great, Sermo 51, 3: PL 54, 310c). 

569 Jesus went up to Jerusalem voluntarily, knowing well that there he would die a violent death 
because of the opposition of sinners (cf. Heb 12:3). 

570 Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem manifests the coming of the kingdom that the Messiah-King, 
welcomed into his city by children and the humble of heart, is going to accomplish by the Passover 
of his Death and Resurrection. 


ARTICLE 4 

“JESUS CHRIST SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS PILATE, WAS CRUCIFIED, DIED, AND 
WAS BURIED” 


571 The Paschal mystery of Christ’s cross and Resurrection stands at the center of the Good News 
that the apostles, and the Church following them, are to proclaim to the world. God’s saving plan 
was accomplished “once for all”3T3 by the redemptive death of his Son Jesus Christ. (1067) 

572 The Church remains faithful to the interpretation of “all the Scriptures” that Jesus gave both 
before and after his Passover: “Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and 
enter into his glory ?”M4 Jesus’ sufferings took their historical, concrete form from the fact that he 







was “rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes,” who handed “him to the Gentiles 
to be mocked and scourged and crucified.”212 (599) 

573 Faith can therefore try to examine the circumstances of Jesus’ death, faithfully handed on by 
the Gospels^ and illuminated by other historical sources, the better to understand the meaning of 
the Redemption. (158) 

Paragraph 1. Jesus and Israel 

574 From the beginning of Jesus’ public ministry, certain Pharisees and partisans of Herod together 
with priests and scribes agreed together to destroy him 1 ■ Because of certain of his acts—expelling 
demons, forgiving sins, healing on the sabbath day, his novel interpretation of the precepts of the 
Law regarding purity, and his familiarity with tax collectors and public sinners^ —some ill- 
intentioned persons suspected Jesus of demonic possession.^ He is accused of blasphemy and 
false prophecy, religious crimes which the Law punished with death by stoning.226 (530, 591 ) 

575 Many of Jesus’ deeds and words constituted a “sign of contradiction, ”221 but more so for the 
religious authorities in Jerusalem, whom the Gospel according to John often calls simply “the 
Jews, ”222 than for the ordinary People of God.223 To be sure, Christ’s relations with the Pharisees 
were not exclusively polemical. Some Pharisees warned him of the danger he was courting;224 
Jesus praises some of them, like the scribe of Mark 12:34, and dines several times at their 
homes.226 Jesus endorses some of the teachings imparted by this religious elite of God’s people: 
the resurrection of the dead, 226 certain forms of piety (almsgiving, fasting, and prayer), 222 the 
custom of addressing God as Father, and the centrality of the commandment to love God and 
neighbor.226 ( 993 ) 

576 In the eyes of many in Israel, Jesus seems to be acting against essential institutions of the 
Chosen People: 

—submission to the whole of the Law in its written commandments and, for the Pharisees, in 
the interpretation of oral tradition; 

—the centrality of the Temple at Jerusalem as the holy place where God’s presence dwells in a 
special way; 

—faith in the one God whose glory no man can share. 


I. Jesus and the Law 









577 At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount Jesus issued a solemn warning in which he 
presented God’s law, given on Sinai during the first covenant, in light of the grace of the New 
Covenant: ( 1965 . 1967 1 

Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets: I have come not to abolish 
but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one 
stroke of a letter, will pass from the law, until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks 
one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least 
in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the 
kingdom of heaven.229 

578 Jesus, Israel’s Messiah and therefore the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, was to fulfill the 
Law by keeping it in its all-embracing detail—according to his own words, down to “the least of 
these commandments. ”220 He is in fact the only one who could keep it perfectly.^ On their own 
admission the Jews were never able to observe the Law in its entirety without violating the least of 
its precepts.222 This is why every year on the Day of Atonement the children of Israel ask God’s 
forgiveness for their transgressions of the Law. The Law indeed makes up one inseparable whole, 
and St. James recalls, “Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all 
of it.”333 ( 1953 ) 

579 This principle of integral observance of the Law not only in letter but in spirit was dear to the 
Pharisees. By giving Israel this principle they had led many Jews of Jesus’ time to an extreme 
religious zeal.— This zeal, were it not to lapse into “hypocritical” casuistry,226 could only prepare 
the People for the unprecedented intervention of God through the perfect fulfillment of the Law by 
the only Righteous One in place of all sinners. 226 

580 The perfect fulfillment of the Law could be the work of none but the divine legislator, born 
subject to the Law in the person of the Son.222 i n Jesus, the Law no longer appears engraved on 
tables of stone but “upon the heart” of the Servant who becomes “a covenant to the people,” 
because he will “faithfully bring forth justice. ”226 Jesus fulfills the Law to the point of taking upon 
himself “the curse of the Law” incurred by those who do not “abide by the things written in the 
book of the Law, and do them,” for his death took place to redeem them “from the transgressions 
under the first covenant.”229 (527) 

581 The Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a rabbi.22Q He often argued 
within the framework of rabbinical interpretation of the Law.221 Yet Jesus could not help but 






offend the teachers of the Law, for he was not content to propose his interpretation alongside theirs 
but taught the people “as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.”242 i n Jesus, the same 
Word of God, that had resounded on Mount Sinai to give the written Law to Moses, made itself 
heard anew on the Mount of the Beatitudes. 243 Jesus did not abolish the Law but fulfilled it by 
giving its ultimate interpretation in a divine way: “You have heard that it was said to the men of 
old.... But I say to you.... ”244 wpf, this same divine authority, he disavowed certain human 
traditions of the Pharisees that were “making void the word of God. ”245 (2054) 

582 Going even further, Jesus perfects the dietary law, so important in Jewish daily life, by 
revealing its pedagogical meaning through a divine interpretation: “Whatever goes into a man from 
outside cannot defile him... (Thus he declared all foods clean.). What comes out of a man is what 
defiles a man. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts.... ”245 j n presenting 
with divine authority the definitive interpretation of the Law, Jesus found himself confronted by 
certain teachers of the Law who did not accept his interpretation of the Law, guaranteed though it 
was by the divine signs that accompanied it.24Z This was the case especially with the sabbath laws, 
for he recalls often with rabbinical arguments, that the sabbath rest is not violated by serving God 
and neighbor, 245 w hi c h his own healings did. (368, 548, 2173 1 

II. Jesus and the Temple 


583 Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest respect for the Temple in Jerusalem. 
It was in the Temple that Joseph and Mary presented him forty days after his birth.249 At the age of 
twelve he decided to remain in the Temple to remind his parents that he must be about his Father’s 
business.250 He wen t there each year during his hidden life at least for Passover.25! His public 
ministry itself was patterned by his pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the great Jewish feasts. 252 (529, 
534 1 

584 Jesus went up to the Temple as the privileged place of encounter with God. For him, the 
Temple was the dwelling of his Father, a house of prayer, and he was angered that its outer court 
had become a place of commerce. 255 He drove merchants out of it because of jealous love for his 
Father: “You shall not make my Father’s house a house of trade. His disciples remembered that it 
was written, ‘Zeal for your house will consume me. ’”254 After his Resurrection his apostles 
retained their reverence for the Temple. 255 ( 2599 1 

585 On the threshold of his Passion Jesus announced the coming destruction of this splendid 
building, of which there would not remain “one stone upon another.”255 By doing so, he announced 









a sign of the last days, which were to begin with his own Passover.^Z But this prophecy would be 
distorted in its telling by false witnesses during his interrogation at the high priest’s house and 
would be thrown back at him as an insult when he was nailed to the cross. ^ 

586 Far from having been hostile to the Temple, where he gave the essential part of his teaching, 
Jesus was willing to pay the temple-tax, associating with him Peter, whom he had just made the 
foundation of his future Church.^ He even identified himself with the Temple by presenting 
himself as God’s definitive dwelling-place among men.^hQ Therefore his being put to bodily 
death^hl presaged the destruction of the Temple, which would manifest the dawning of a new age 
in the history of salvation: “The hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem 
will you worship the Father.”^ ( 797 , 1179 ) 

III. Jesus and Israel’s Faith in the One God and Savior 


587 If the Law and the Jerusalem Temple could be occasions of opposition to Jesus by Israel’s 
religious authorities, his role in the redemption of sins, the divine work par excellence, was the true 
stumbling-block for them.^S3 

588 Jesus scandalized the Pharisees by eating with tax collectors and sinners as familiarly as with 
themselves.^ Against those among them “who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and 
despised others,” Jesus affirmed: “I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to 
repentance.”^ He went further by proclaiming before the Pharisees that, since sin is universal, 
those who pretend not to need salvation are blind to themselves. ( 545 ^ 

589 Jesus gave scandal above all when he identified his merciful conduct toward sinners with 
God’s own attitude toward them.^Z He went so far as to hint that by sharing the table of sinners he 
was admitting them to the messianic banquet.^ But it was most especially by forgiving sins that 
Jesus placed the religious authorities of Israel on the horns of a dilemma. Were they not entitled to 
demand in consternation, “Who can forgive sins but God alone?”^ By forgiving sins Jesus either 
is blaspheming as a man who made himself God’s equal or is speaking the truth, and his person 
really does make present and reveal God’s name.^ZQ (431, 1441 . 432) 

590 Only the divine identity of Jesus’ person can justify so absolute a claim as “He who is not with 
me is against me”; and his saying that there was in him “something greater than Jonah,... greater 
than Solomon,” something “greater than the Temple”; his reminder that David had called the 
Messiah his Lord,^i and his affirmations, “Before Abraham was, I AM”; and even “I and the 








Father are one. ”272 ( 253 1 


591 Jesus asked the religious authorities of Jerusalem to believe in him because of the Father’s 
works which he accomplished.^ But such an act of faith must go through a mysterious death to 
self, for a new “birth from above” under the influence of divine grace. 274 Such a demand for 
conversion in the face of so surprising a fulfillment of the promises^ allows one to understand the 
Sanhedrin’s tragic misunderstanding of Jesus: they judged that he deserved the death sentence as a 
blasphemer.^ The members of the Sanhedrin were thus acting at the same time out of “ignorance” 
and the “hardness” of their “unbelief.”277 (526, 574) 


IN BRIEF 


592 Jesus did not abolish the Law of Sinai, but rather fulfilled it (cf. Mt 5:17-19) with such 
perfection (cf. Jn 8:46) that he revealed its ultimate meaning (cf. Mt 5:33) and redeemed the 
transgressions against it (cf. Heb 9:15). 

593 Jesus venerated the Temple by going up to it for the Jewish feasts of pilgrimage, and with a 
jealous love he loved this dwelling of God among men. The Temple prefigures his own mystery. 
When he announces its destruction, it is as a manifestation of his own execution and of the entry 
into a new age in the history of salvation, when his Body would be the definitive Temple. 

594 Jesus performed acts, such as pardoning sins, that manifested him to be the Savior God himself 
(cf. Jn 5:16-18). Certain Jews, who did not recognize God made man (cf. Jn 1:14), saw in him only 
a man who made himself God (Jn 10:33), and judged him as a blasphemer.

Paragraph 2. Jesus Died Crucified 

I. The Trial of Jesus 


Divisions among the Jewish authorities concerning Jesus 

595 Among the religious authorities of Jerusalem, not only were the Pharisee Nicodemus and the 
prominent Joseph of Arimathea both secret disciples of Jesus, but there was also long-standing 
dissension about him, so much so that St. John says of these authorities on the very eve of Christ’s 
Passion, “many... believed in him,” though very imperfectly. 278 This is not surprising, if one recalls 
that on the day after Pentecost “a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith” and “some 
believers... belonged to the party of the Pharisees,” to the point that St. James could tell St. Paul, 
“How many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; and they are all 
zealous for the Law.”279 

596 The religious authorities in Jerusalem were not unanimous about what stance to take toward 
Jesus .280 The Pharisees threatened to excommunicate his followers. 281 To those who feared that 
“everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our 


nation,” the high priest Caiaphas replied by prophesying: “It is expedient for you that one man 
should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish. ”222 The Sanhedrin, having 
declared Jesus deserving of death as a blasphemer but having lost the right to put anyone to death, 
hands him over to the Romans, accusing him of political revolt, a charge that puts him in the same 
category as Barabbas who had been accused of sedition.223 The high priests also threatened Pilate 
politically so that he would condemn Jesus to death.2M (1753) 

Jews are not collectively responsible for Jesus’ death 

597 The historical complexity of Jesus’ trial is apparent in the Gospel accounts. The personal sin of 
the participants (Judas, the Sanhedrin, Pilate) is known to God alone. Hence we cannot lay 
responsibility for the trial on the Jews in Jerusalem as a whole, despite the outcry of a manipulated 
crowd and the global reproaches contained in the apostles’ calls to conversion after Pentecost.^ 
Jesus himself, in forgiving them on the cross, and Peter in following suit, both accept “the 
ignorance” of the Jews of Jerusalem and even of their leaders. 222 still less can we extend 
responsibility to other Jews of different times and places, based merely on the crowd’s cry: “His 
blood be on us and on our children!” a formula for ratifying a judicial sentence.22Z As the Church 
declared at the Second Vatican Council: ( 1735 . 839) 

...[N]either all Jews indiscriminately at that time, nor Jews today, can be charged with the 
crimes committed during his Passion.... [T]he Jews should not be spoken of as rejected or 
accursed as if this followed from holy Scripture. 222 

All sinners were the authors of Christ’s Passion 

598 In her Magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness of her saints, the Church has never 
forgotten that “sinners were the authors and the ministers of all the sufferings that the divine 
Redeemer endured.”^ Taking into account the fact that our sins affect Christ himself, 222 the 
Church does not hesitate to impute to Christians the gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted 
upon Jesus, a responsibility with which they have all too often burdened the Jews alone: ( 1851 1 

We must regard as guilty all those who continue to relapse into their sins. Since our sins made 
the Lord Christ suffer the torment of the cross, those who plunge themselves into disorders 
and crimes crucify the Son of God anew in their hearts (for he is in them) and hold him up to 
contempt. And it can be seen that our crime in this case is greater in us than in the Jews. As for 
them, according to the witness of the Apostle, “None of the rulers of this age understood this; 
for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.” We, however, profess to 






know him. And when we deny him by our deeds, we in some way seem to lay violent hands 
on him.221 

Nor did demons crucify him; it is you who have crucified him and crucify him still, when you 
delight in your vices and sins.222 

II. Christ’s Redemptive Death in God’s Plan of Salvation 


“Jesus handed over according to the definite plan of God” 

599 Jesus’ violent death was not the result of chance in an unfortunate coincidence of 
circumstances, but is part of the mystery of God’s plan, as St. Peter explains to the Jews of 
Jerusalem in his first sermon on Pentecost: “This Jesus [was] delivered up according to the definite 
plan and foreknowledge of God.”223 This Biblical language does not mean that those who handed 
him over were merely passive players in a scenario written in advance by God.— ( 517 ) 

600 To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his 
eternal plan of “predestination,” he includes in it each person’s free response to his grace: “In this 
city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered 
together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your 
plan had predestined to take place. ”225 p or t p e sa ^ e 0 f accomplishing his plan of salvation, God 
permitted the acts that flowed from their blindness.226 ( 312 ] 

“He died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures” 

601 The Scriptures had foretold this divine plan of salvation through the putting to death of “the 
righteous one, my Servant” as a mystery of universal redemption, that is, as the ransom that would 
free men from the slavery of sin.22Z Citing a confession of faith that he himself had “received,” St. 
Paul professes that “Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures. ”222 i n particular 
Jesus’ redemptive death fulfills Isaiah’s prophecy of the suffering Servant.222 Indeed Jesus himself 
explained the meaning of his life and death in the light of God’s suffering Servant. 422 After his 
Resurrection he gave this interpretation of the Scriptures to the disciples at Emmaus, and then to 
the apostles.421 [ 652 . 713 ] 

“For our sake God made him to be sin” 


602 Consequently, St. Peter can formulate the apostolic faith in the divine plan of salvation in this 






way: “You were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your fathers... with the precious 
blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was destined before the foundation 
of the world but was made manifest at the end of the times for your sake. ”402 Man’s sins, following 
on original sin, are punishable by death.423 gy sending his own Son in the form of a slave, in the 
form of a fallen humanity, on account of sin, God “made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in 
him we might become the righteousness of God.”424 (400, 519 ] 

603 Jesus did not experience reprobation as if he himself had sinned.425 gut in the redeeming love 
that always united him to the Father, he assumed us in the state of our waywardness of sin, to the 
point that he could say in our name from the cross: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken 
me ?”406 Having thus established him in solidarity with us sinners, God “did not spare his own Son 
but gave him up for us all,” so that we might be “reconciled to God by the death of his Son.”42Z 
(25Z 2) 

God takes the initiative of universal redeeming love 

604 By giving up his own Son for our sins, God manifests that his plan for us is one of benevolent 
love, prior to any merit on our part: “In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and 
sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins. ”422 God “shows his love for us in that while we were 
yet sinners Christ died for us. ”422 ( 211 . 2009 . 1825 1 

605 At the end of the parable of the lost sheep Jesus recalled that God’s love excludes no one: “So 
it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.”4!2 He 
affirms that he came “to give his life as a ransom for many”; this last term is not restrictive, but 
contrasts the whole of humanity with the unique person of the redeemer who hands himself over to 
save us.411 The Church, following the apostles, teaches that Christ died for all men without 
exception: “There is not, never has been, and never will be a single human being for whom Christ 
did not suffer.”412 ( 402 , 634, 2793 1 

III. Christ Offered Himself to His Father for Our Sins 


Christ’s whole life is an offering to the Father 

606 The Son of God, who came down “from heaven, not to do [his] own will, but the will of him 
who sent [him], ”412 said on coming into the world, “Lo, I have come to do your will, O God.” 
“And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for 











all.”— From the first moment of his Incarnation the Son embraces the Father’s plan of divine 
salvation in his redemptive mission: “My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to 
accomplish his work.”4L5 The sacrifice of Jesus “for the sins of the whole world”41h expresses his 
loving communion with the Father. “The Father loves me, because I lay down my life,” said the 
Lord, “[for] I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the 
Father.”^ (517, 536) 

607 The desire to embrace his Father’s plan of redeeming love inspired Jesus’ whole life, 418 for his 
redemptive passion was the very reason for his Incarnation. And so he asked, “And what shall I 
say? 'Father, save me from this hour’? No, for this purpose I have come to this hour.”412 And 
again, “Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?”^ From the cross, just before “It 
is finished,” he said, “I thirst.”421 ( 457 ) 

“The Lamb who takes away the sin of the world” 

608 After agreeing to baptize him along with the sinners, John the Baptist looked at Jesus and 
pointed him out as the “Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.”42l By doing so, he 
reveals that Jesus is at the same time the suffering Servant who silently allows himself to be led to 
the slaughter and who bears the sin of the multitudes, and also the Paschal Lamb, the symbol of 
Israel’s redemption at the first Passover.422 Christ’s whole life expresses his mission: “to serve and 
to give his life as a ransom for many. ”424 [ 523 . 517 1 

Jesus freely embraced the Father’s redeeming love 

609 By embracing in his human heart the Father’s love for men, Jesus “loved them to the end,” for 
“greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. ”425 j n suffering and 
death his humanity became the free and perfect instrument of his divine love which desires the 
salvation of men.426 Indeed, out of love for his Father and for men, whom the Father wants to save, 
Jesus freely accepted his Passion and death: “No one takes [my life] from me, but I lay it down of 
my own accord.”42Z Hence the sovereign freedom of God’s Son as he went out to his death.428 
1 478 . 515 . 272 . 539 1 

At the Last Supper Jesus anticipated the free offering of his life 

610 Jesus gave the supreme expression of his free offering of himself at the meal shared with the 
twelve Apostles “on the night he was betrayed.”429 On the eve of his Passion, while still free, Jesus 
transformed this Last Supper with the apostles into the memorial of his voluntary offering to the 
Father for the salvation of men: “This is my body which is given for you.” “This is my blood of the 











covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”42Q (766 . 1337 ) 


611 The Eucharist that Christ institutes at that moment will be the memorial of his sacrifice.421 
Jesus includes the apostles in his own offering and bids them perpetuate it .422 By doing so, the 
Lord institutes his apostles as priests of the New Covenant: “For their sakes I sanctify myself, so 
that they also may be sanctified in truth.”423 ( 1364 . 1341 . 1566 1 

The agony at Gethsemani 

612 The cup of the New Covenant, which Jesus anticipated when he offered himself at the Last 
Supper, is afterwards accepted by him from his Father’s hands in his agony in the garden at 
Gethsemani, 434 ma king himself “obedient unto death.” Jesus prays: “My Father, if it be possible, 
let this cup pass from me.... ”425 Thus he expresses the horror that death represented for his human 
nature. Like ours, his human nature is destined for eternal life; but unlike ours, it is perfectly 
exempt from sin, the cause of death.42b Above all, his human nature has been assumed by the 
divine person of the “Author of life,” the “Living One.”42Z By accepting in his human will that the 
Father’s will be done, he accepts his death as redemptive, for “he himself bore our sins in his body 
on the tree. ”423 ( 53 ^ 2600, 1009 1 

Christ’s death is the unique and definitive sacrifice 

613 Christ’s death is both the Paschal sacrifice that accomplishes the definitive redemption of men, 
through “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, ”422 and the sacrifice of the New 
Covenant, which restores man to communion with God by reconciling him to God through the 
“blood of the covenant, which was poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”44Q ( 1366 . 
2009 1 

614 This sacrifice of Christ is unique; it completes and surpasses all other sacrifices.441 First, it is a 
gift from God the Father himself, for the Father handed his Son over to sinners in order to reconcile 
us with himself. At the same time it is the offering of the Son of God made man, who in freedom 
and love offered his life to his Father through the Holy Spirit in reparation for our disobedience. 442 
( 529 . 1330 . 2100 1 

Jesus substitutes his obedience for our disobedience 

615 “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man’s obedience many 
will be made righteous. ”443 By his obedience unto death, Jesus accomplished the substitution of the 















suffering Servant, who “makes himself an offering for sin,” when “he bore the sin of many,” and 
who “shall make many to be accounted righteous,” for “he shall bear their iniquities.”^ Jesus 
atoned for our faults and made satisfaction for our sins to the Father.^ (1850, 433 . 411 ) 

Jesus consummates his sacrifice on the Cross 

616 It is love “to the end”^6 that confers on Christ’s sacrifice its value as redemption and 
reparation, as atonement and satisfaction. He knew and loved us all when he offered his life.l^ 
Now “the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that one has died for all; therefore 
all have died.”^ No man, not even the holiest, was ever able to take on himself the sins of all men 
and offer himself as a sacrifice for all. The existence in Christ of the divine person of the Son, who 
at once surpasses and embraces all human persons and constitutes himself as the Head of all 
mankind, makes possible his redemptive sacrifice for all. (478, 468 . 519 1 

617 The Council of Trent emphasizes the unique character of Christ’s sacrifice as “the source of 
eternal salvation”^ and teaches that “his most holy Passion on the wood of the cross merited 
justification for us.”4S2 And the Church venerates his cross as it sings: “Hail, O Cross, our only 
hope. ”4^ 1 1992 . 1235 . 1368 . 1460 . 307 . 2100 . 964 1 

Our participation in Christ’s sacrifice 

618 The cross is the unique sacrifice of Christ, the “one mediator between God and men.”4£2 But 
because in his incarnate divine person he has in some way united himself to every man, “the 
possibility of being made partners, in a way known to God, in the 

paschal mystery” is offered to all men.4^ He calls his disciples to “take up [their] cross and follow 
[him],”4M for “Christ also suffered for [us], leaving [us] an example so that [we] should follow in 
his steps. ”455 i n fact Jesus desires to associate with his redeeming sacrifice those who were to be its 
first beneficiaries.^ This is achieved supremely in the case of his mother, who was associated 
more intimately than any other person in the mystery of his redemptive suffering.^ 

Apart from the cross there is no other ladder by which we may get to heaven.458 


IN BRIEF 


619 “Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures” (1 Cor 15:3). 

















620 Our salvation flows from God’s initiative of love for us, because “he loved us and sent his Son 
to be the expiation for our sins” (1 Jn 4:10). “God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself” 
(2 Cor 5:19). 

621 Jesus freely offered himself for our salvation. Beforehand, during the Last Supper, he both 
symbolized this offering and made it really present: “This is my body which is given for you” ( Lk 
22:19). 

622 The redemption won by Christ consists in this, that he came “to give his life as a ransom for 
many” (Mt 20:28), that is, he “loved [his own] to the end” (Jn 13:1), so that they might be 
“ransomed from the futile ways inherited from [their] fathers”(l Pet 1:18). 

623 By his loving obedience to the Father, “unto death, even death on a cross” (Phil 2:8), Jesus 
fulfills the atoning mission (cf. Isa 53:10) of the suffering Servant, who will “make many 
righteous; and he shall bear their iniquities” (Isa 53:11; cf. Rom 5:19). 


Paragraph 3. Jesus Christ Was Buried 

624 “By the grace of God” Jesus tasted death “for every one.”^ In his plan of salvation, God 
ordained that his Son should not only “die for our sins”^ but should also “taste death,” experience 
the condition of death, the separation of his soul from his body, between the time he expired on the 
cross and the time he was raised from the dead. The state of the dead Christ is the mystery of the 
tomb and the descent into hell. It is the mystery of Holy Saturday, when Christ, lying in the 
tomb,reveals God’s great sabbath rest^h2 after the fulfillment^ of man’s salvation, which 
brings peace to the whole universe.^ ( 1005 . 362 . 349) 

Christ in the tomb in his body 

625 Christ’s stay in the tomb constitutes the real link between his passible state before Easter and 
his glorious and risen state today. The same person of the “Living One” can say, “I died, and 
behold I am alive for evermore” 

God [the Son] did not impede death from separating his soul from his body according to the 
necessary order of nature, but has reunited them to one another in the Resurrection, so that he 
himself might be, in his person, the meeting point for death and life, by arresting in himself the 
decomposition of nature produced by death and so becoming the source of reunion for the 







separated parts. ^ 

626 Since the “Author of life” who was killed^ is the same “living one [who has] risen, ”4^ the 
divine person of the Son of God necessarily continued to possess his human soul and body, 
separated from each other by death: ( 470 . 650 ) 

By the fact that at Christ’s death his soul was separated from his flesh, his one person is not 
itself divided into two persons; for the human body and soul of Christ have existed in the same 
way from the beginning of his earthly existence, in the divine person of the Word; and in 
death, although separated from each other, both remained with one and the same person of the 
Word.— 


“You will not let your Holy One see corruption” 

627 Christ’s death was a real death in that it put an end to his earthly human existence. But because 
of the union which the person of the Son retained with his body, his was not a mortal corpse like 
others, for “it was not possible for death to hold him”4Z2 and therefore “divine power preserved 
Christ’s body from corruption.”^ Both of these statements can be said of Christ: “He was cut off 
out of the land of the living, ”4Z2 and “My flesh will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my 
soul to Hades, nor let your Holy One see corruption.”^ Jesus’ Resurrection “on the third day” was 
the sign of this also, because bodily decay was held to begin on the fourth day after death.^4 
( 1009 . 1683 1 

“Buried with Christ...” 

628 Baptism, the original and full sign of which is immersion, efficaciously signifies the descent 
into the tomb by the Christian who dies to sin with Christ in order to live a new life. “We were 
buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the 
glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. ”4^2 [ 537 . 1214 1 


IN BRIEF 


629 To the benefit of every man, Jesus Christ tasted death (cf. Heb 2:9). It is truly the Son of God 
made man who died and was buried. 


630 During Christ’s period in the tomb, his divine person continued to assume both his soul and his 










body, although they were separated from each other by death. For this reason the dead Christ’s 
body “saw no corruption” (Acts 13:37).

ARTICLE 5 

“HE DESCENDED INTO HELL ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN” 


631 Jesus “descended into the lower parts of the earth. He who descended is he who also ascended 
far above all the heavens. ”4Zh The Apostles’ Creed confesses in the same article Christ’s descent 
into hell and his Resurrection from the dead on the third day, because in his Passover it was 
precisely out of the depths of death that he made life spring forth: 

Christ, that Morning Star, who came back from the dead, 

and shed his peaceful light on all mankind, 

your Son who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.4ZZ 

Paragraph 1. Christ Descended into Hell 

632 The frequent New Testament affirmations that Jesus was “raised from the dead” presuppose 
that the crucified one sojourned in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection.^ This was the 
first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ’s descent into hell: that Jesus, like all men, 
experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead. But he descended there 
as Savior, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there. 4Z9 

633 Scripture calls the abode of the dead, to which the dead Christ went down, “hell” — Sheol in 
Hebrew or Hades in Greek—because those who are there are deprived of the vision of God.42Q 
Such is the case for all the dead, whether evil or righteous, while they await the redeemer: which 
does not mean that their lot is identical, as Jesus shows through the parable of the poor man 
Lazarus who was received into “Abraham’s bosom”:42i “It is precisely these holy souls, who 
awaited their Savior in Abraham’s bosom, whom Christ the Lord delivered when he descended into 
hell. ”422 Jesus did not descend into hell to deliver the damned, nor to destroy the hell of damnation, 
but to free the just who had gone before him.423 ( 1Q33 ) 

634 “The gospel was preached even to the dead.”4M The descent into hell brings the Gospel 
message of salvation to complete fulfillment. This is the last phase of Jesus’ messianic mission, a 
phase which is condensed in time but vast in its real significance: the spread of Christ’s redemptive 
work to all men of all times and all places, for all who are saved have been made sharers in the 
redemption. (605) 






635 Christ went down into the depths of death so that “the dead will hear the voice of the Son of 
God, and those who hear will live. ”425 Jesus, “the Author of life,” by dying destroyed “him who 
has the power of death, that is, the devil, and [delivered] all those who through fear of death were 
subject to lifelong bondage. ”422 Henceforth the risen Christ holds “the keys of Death and Hades,” 
so that “at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the 
earth. ”42Z 

Today a great silence reigns on earth, a great silence and a great stillness. A great silence 
because the King is asleep. The earth trembled and is still because God has fallen asleep in the 
flesh and he has raised up all who have slept ever since the world began.... He has gone to 
search for Adam, our first father, as for a lost sheep. Greatly desiring to visit those who live in 
darkness and in the shadow of death, he has gone to free from sorrow Adam in his bonds and 
Eve, captive with him—He who is both their God and the son of Eve....” I am your God, who 
for your sake have become your son.... I order you, O sleeper, to awake. I did not create you to 
be a prisoner in hell. Rise from the dead, for I am the life of the dead. ”422 


IN BRIEF 


636 By the expression “He descended into hell,” the Apostles’ Creed confesses that Jesus did really 
die and through his death for us conquered death and the devil “who has the power of death” (Heb 
2:14). 

637 In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead Christ went down to the realm of the 
dead. He opened heaven’s gates for the just who had gone before him. 


Paragraph 2. On the Third Day He Rose from the Dead 

638 “We bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this day he has fulfilled to 
us their children by raising Jesus. ”422 The Resurrection of Jesus is the crowning truth of our faith in 
Christ, a faith believed and lived as the central truth by the first Christian community; handed on as 
fundamental by Tradition; established by the documents of the New Testament; and preached as an 
essential part of the Paschal mystery along with the cross: (90, 651, 991 ) 


Christ is risen from the dead! 









Dying, he conquered death; 

To the dead, he has given life.492 

I. The Historical and Transcendent Event 


639 The mystery of Christ’s resurrection is a real event, with manifestations that were historically 
verified, as the New Testament bears witness. In about A.D. 56, St. Paul could already write to the 
Corinthians: “I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our 
sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in 
accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve...”^ Apostle 
speaks here of the living tradition of the Resurrection which he had learned after his conversion at 

the gates of Damascus.^ 

The empty tomb 

640 “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen.”^ The first 
element we encounter in the framework of the Easter events is the empty tomb. In itself it is not a 
direct proof of Resurrection; the absence of Christ’s body from the tomb could be explained 
otherwise.; 494 Nonetheless the empty tomb was still an essential sign for all. Its discovery by the 
disciples was the first step toward recognizing the very fact of the Resurrection. This was the case, 
first with the holy women, and then with Peter.425 The disciple “whom Jesus loved” affirmed that 
when he entered the empty tomb and discovered “the linen cloths lying there,” “he saw and 
believed.”^ This suggests that he realized from the empty tomb’s condition that the absence of 
Jesus’ body could not have been of human doing and that Jesus had not simply returned to earthly 
life as had been the case with Lazarus.^Z (999) 

The appearances of the Risen One 

641 Mary Magdalene and the holy women who came to finish anointing the body of Jesus, which 
had been buried in haste because the Sabbath began on the evening of Good Friday, were the first 
to encounter the Risen One.^ Thus the women were the first messengers of Christ’s Resurrection 
for the apostles themselves.^ They were the next to whom Jesus appears: first Peter, then the 
Twelve. Peter had been called to strengthen the faith of his brothers,^ and so sees the Risen One 
before them; it is on the basis of his testimony that the community exclaims: “The Lord has risen 
indeed, and has appeared to Simon !”^1 (553, 448 1 


642 Everything that happened during those Paschal days involves each of the apostles—and Peter 





in particular—in the building of the new era begun on Easter morning. As witnesses of the Risen 
One, they remain the foundation stones of his Church. The faith of the first community of believers 
is based on the witness of concrete men known to the Christians and for the most part still living 
among them. Peter and the Twelve are the primary “witnesses to his Resurrection,” but they are not 
the only ones—Paul speaks clearly of more than five hundred persons to whom Jesus appeared on a 
single occasion and also of James and of all the apostles.^2 (659, 881, 860) 

643 Given all these testimonies, Christ’s Resurrection cannot be interpreted as something outside 
the physical order, and it is impossible not to acknowledge it as an historical fact. It is clear from 
the facts that the disciples’ faith was drastically put to the test by their master’s Passion and death 
on the cross, which he had foretold.^3 The shock provoked by the Passion was so great that at least 
some of the disciples did not at once believe in the news of the Resurrection. Far from showing us a 
community seized by a mystical exaltation, the Gospels present us with disciples demoralized 
(“looking sad”^24) and frightened. For they had not believed the holy women returning from the 
tomb and had regarded their words as an “idle tale.”^ when Jesus reveals himself to the Eleven 
on Easter evening, “he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had 
not believed those who saw him after he had risen.”^ 

644 Even when faced with the reality of the risen Jesus the disciples are still doubtful, so 
impossible did the thing seem: they thought they were seeing a ghost. “In their joy they were still 
disbelieving and still wondering. ”^Z Thomas will also experience the test of doubt and St. 
Matthew relates that during the risen Lord’s last appearance in Galilee “some doubted.”^ 
Therefore the hypothesis that the Resurrection was produced by the apostles’ faith (or credulity) 
will not hold up. On the contrary their faith in the Resurrection was born, under the action of divine 
grace, from their direct experience of the reality of the risen Jesus. 

The condition of Christ’s risen humanity 

645 By means of touch and the sharing of a meal, the risen Jesus establishes direct contact with his 
disciples. He invites them in this way to recognize that he is not a ghost and above all to verify that 
the risen body in which he appears to them is the same body that had been tortured and crucified, 
for it still bears the traces of his passion.^ Yet at the same time this authentic, real body possesses 
the new properties of a glorious body: not limited by space and time but able to be present how and 
when he wills; for Christ’s humanity can no longer be confined to earth and belongs henceforth 
only to the Father’s divine realm.^ For this reason too the risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign 
freedom of appearing as he wishes: in the guise of a gardener or in other forms familiar to his 





disciples, precisely to awaken their faith.^U (999) 


646 Christ’s Resurrection was not a return to earthly life, as was the case with the raisings from the 
dead that he had performed before Easter: Jairus’ daughter, the young man of Naim, Lazarus. These 
actions were miraculous events, but the persons miraculously raised returned by Jesus’ power to 
ordinary earthly life. At some particular moment they would die again. Christ’s Resurrection is 
essentially different. In his risen body he passes from the state of death to another life beyond time 
and space. At Jesus’ Resurrection his body is filled with the power of the Holy Spirit: he shares the 
divine life in his glorious state, so that St. Paul can say that Christ is “the man of heaven.”^ (934, 
549) 

The Resurrection as transcendent event 

647 O truly blessed Night, sings the Exsultet of the Easter Vigil, which alone deserved to know the 
time and the hour when Christ rose from the realm of the dead!^ But no one was an eyewitness to 
Christ’s Resurrection and no evangelist describes it. No one can say how it came about physically. 
Still less was its innermost essence, his passing over to another life, perceptible to the senses. 
Although the Resurrection was an historical event that could be verified by the sign of the empty 
tomb and by the reality of the apostles’ encounters with the risen Christ, still it remains at the very 
heart of the mystery of faith as something that transcends and surpasses history. This is why the 
risen Christ does not reveal himself to the world, but to his disciples, “to those who came up with 
him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.”^ (1000) 

II. The Resurrection—A Work of the Holy Trinity 


648 Christ’s Resurrection is an object of faith in that it is a transcendent intervention of God 
himself in creation and history. In it the three divine persons act together as one, and manifest their 
own proper characteristics. The Father’s power “raised up” Christ his Son and by doing so perfectly 
introduced his Son’s humanity, including his body, into the Trinity. Jesus is conclusively revealed 
as “Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his Resurrection from the dead.”^ 
St. Paul insists on the manifestation of God’s power^ through the working of the Spirit who gave 
life to Jesus’ dead humanity and called it to the glorious state of Lordship. ( 258 . 989 . 663 . 445 . 
272 1 

649 As for the Son, he effects his own Resurrection by virtue of his divine power. Jesus announces 
that the Son of man will have to suffer much, die, and then rise. 4k Elsewhere he affirms explicitly: 











“I lay down my life, that I may take it again.... I have power to lay it down, and I have power to 
take it again.”^18 “We believe that Jesus died and rose again.”^19 

650 The Fathers contemplate the Resurrection from the perspective of the divine person of Christ 
who remained united to his soul and body, even when these were separated from each other by 
death: “By the unity of the divine nature, which remains present in each of the two components of 
man, these are reunited. For as death is produced by the separation of the human components, so 
Resurrection is achieved by the union of the two.”^Q (626, 1005 1 

III. The Meaning and Saving Significance of the Resurrection 


651 “If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.”^ The 
Resurrection above all constitutes the confirmation of all Christ’s works and teachings. All truths, 
even those most inaccessible to human reason, find their justification if Christ by his Resurrection 
has given the definitive proof of his divine authority, which he had promised. ( 129 . 274 ) 

652 Christ’s Resurrection is the fulfillment of the promises both of the Old Testament and of Jesus 
himself during his earthly life. ^22 The phrase “in accordance with the Scriptures”^ indicates that 
Christ’s Resurrection fulfilled these predictions. ( 994 . 601 1 

653 The truth of Jesus’ divinity is confirmed by his Resurrection. He had said: “When you have 
lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he.”^4 The Resurrection of the crucified 
one shows that he was truly “I Am,” the Son of God and God himself. So St. Paul could declare to 
the Jews: “What God promised to the fathers, this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising 
Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, 'You are my Son, today I have begotten you . ’”^2 
Christ’s Resurrection is closely linked to the Incarnation of God’s Son and is its fulfillment in 
accordance with God’s eternal plan. ( 445 . 461 . 422 1 

654 The Paschal mystery has two aspects: by his death, Christ liberates us from sin; by his 
Resurrection, he opens for us the way to a new life. This new life is above all justification that 
reinstates us in God’s grace, “so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, 
we too might walk in newness of life. ”526 Justification consists in both victory over the death 
caused by sin and a new participation in grace. ^ it brings about filial adoption so that men 
become Christ’s brethren, as Jesus himself called his disciples after his Resurrection: “Go and tell 
my brethren.”^ We are brethren not by nature, but by the gift of grace, because that adoptive 
filiation gains us a real share in the life of the only Son, which was fully revealed in his 











Resurrection. ( 1987 . 1996 ) 


655 Finally, Christ’s Resurrection—and the risen Christ himself—is the principle and source of our 
future resurrection: “Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen 
asleep.... For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. The risen Christ lives 
in the hearts of his faithful while they await that fulfillment. In Christ, Christians “have tasted... the 
powers of the age to come”^Q and their lives are swept up by Christ into the heart of divine life, so 
that they may “live no longer for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was 
raised.”^! (989, 1002 1 


IN BRIEF 


656 Faith in the Resurrection has as its object an event which is historically attested to by the 
disciples, who really encountered the Risen One. At the same time, this event is mysteriously 
transcendent insofar as it is the entry of Christ’s humanity into the glory of God. 

657 The empty tomb and the linen cloths lying there signify in themselves that by God’s power 
Christ’s body had escaped the bonds of death and corruption. They prepared the disciples to 
encounter the Risen Lord. 

658 Christ, “the first-born from the dead” (Col 1:18), is the principle of our own resurrection, even 
now by the justification of our souls (cf. Rom 6:4), and one day by the new life he will impart to 
our bodies (cf. Rom 8:11).

ARTICLE 6 

“HE ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN AND IS SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE 
FATHER” 


659 “So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down 
at the right hand of God.”555 Christ’s body was glorified at the moment of his Resurrection, as 
proved by the new and supernatural properties it subsequently and permanently enjoys. 551 But 
during the forty days when he eats and drinks familiarly with his disciples and teaches them about 
the kingdom, his glory remains veiled under the appearance of ordinary humanity. 554 Jesus’ final 
apparition ends with the irreversible entry of his humanity into divine glory, symbolized by the 
cloud and by heaven, where he is seated from that time forward at God’s right hand.555 Only in a 
wholly exceptional and unique way would Jesus show himself to Paul “as to one untimely born,” in 
a last apparition that established him as an apostle.556 (645, 66, 697, 642) 


660 The veiled character of the glory of the Risen One during this time is intimated in his 
mysterious words to Mary Magdalene: “I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my 









brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your 
God.”^ This indicates a difference in manifestation between the glory of the risen Christ and that 
of the Christ exalted to the Father’s right hand, a transition marked by the historical and 
transcendent event of the Ascension. 

661 This final stage stays closely linked to the first, that is, to his descent from heaven in the 
Incarnation. Only the one who “came from the Father” can return to the Father: Christ Jesus.^38 
“No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man.”^9 Left to 
its own natural powers humanity does not have access to the “Father’s house,” to God’s life and 
happiness .^Q Only Christ can open to man such access that we, his members, might have 
confidence that we too shall go where he, our Head and our Source, has preceded us. ^41 (461, 792) 

662 “And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.”^ The lifting up of 
Jesus on the cross signifies and announces his lifting up by his Ascension into heaven, and indeed 
begins it. Jesus Christ, the one priest of the new and eternal Covenant, “entered, not into a 
sanctuary made by human hands... but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on 
our behalf.”S43 There Christ permanently exercises his priesthood, for he “always lives to make 
intercession” for “those who draw near to God through him.”^4 As “high priest of the good things 
to come” he is the center and the principal actor of the liturgy that honors the Father in heaven.^ 
(1545, 1137 1 

663 Henceforth Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father: “By The Father’s right hand’ we 
understand the glory and honor of divinity, where he who exists as Son of God before all ages, 
indeed as God, of one being with the Father, is seated bodily after he became incarnate and his 
flesh was glorified.”^ (648) 

664 Being seated at the Father’s right hand signifies the inauguration of the Messiah’s kingdom, the 
fulfillment of the prophet Daniel’s vision concerning the Son of man: “To him was given dominion 
and glory and kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is 
an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be 
destroyed.”^' After this event the apostles became witnesses of the “kingdom [that] will have no 

end.”^ (541) 


IN BRIEF 










665 Christ’s ascension marks the definitive entrance of Jesus’ humanity into God’s heavenly 
domain, whence he will come again (cf. Acts 1:11); this humanity in the meantime hides him from 
the eyes of men (cf. Col 3:3). 

666 Jesus Christ, the head of the Church, precedes us into the Father’s glorious kingdom so that we, 
the members of his Body, may live in the hope of one day being with him for ever. 

667 Jesus Christ, having entered the sanctuary of heaven once and for all, intercedes constantly for 
us as the mediator who assures us of the permanent outpouring of the Holy Spirit. 


ARTICLE 7 

“FROM THENCE HE WILL COME AGAIN TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD” 


I. He Will Come Again in Glory 

Christ already reigns through the Church... 

668 “Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.”^ 
Christ’s Ascension into heaven signifies his participation, in his humanity, in God’s power and 
authority. Jesus Christ is Lord: he possesses all power in heaven and on earth. He is “far above all 
rule and authority and power and dominion,” for the Father “has put all things under his feet.”^ 
Christ is Lord of the cosmos and of history. In him human history and indeed all creation are “set 
forth” and transcendently fulfilled.^ (450, 518 1 

669 As Lord, Christ is also head of the Church, which is his Body.^2 Taken up to heaven and 
glorified after he had thus fully accomplished his mission, Christ dwells on earth in his Church. The 
redemption is the source of the authority that Christ, by virtue of the Holy Spirit, exercises over the 
Church. “The kingdom of Christ [is] already present in mystery,” “on earth, the seed and the 
beginning of the kingdom.”^ ( 792 . 1088 . 541 1 

670 Since the Ascension God’s plan has entered into its fulfillment. We are already at “the last 
hour. ”^24 “Already the final age of the world is with us, and the renewal of the world is irrevocably 
under way; it is even now anticipated in a certain real way, for the Church on earth is endowed 
already with a sanctity that is real but imperfect.”^ Christ’s kingdom already manifests its 
presence through the miraculous signs that attend its proclamation by the Church.^ ( 1042 . 825 . 
547 1 



















...until all things are subjected to him 


671 Though already present in his Church, Christ’s reign is nevertheless yet to be fulfilled “with 
power and great glory” by the king’s return to earth.^Z This reign is still under attack by the evil 
powers, even though they have been defeated definitively by Christ’s Passover.^ Until everything 
is subject to him, “until there be realized new heavens and a new earth in which justice dwells, the 
pilgrim Church, in her sacraments and institutions, which belong to this present age, carries the 
mark of this world which will pass, and she herself takes her place among the creatures which 
groan and travail yet and await the revelation of the sons of God.”— That is why Christians pray, 
above all in the Eucharist, to hasten Christ’s return by saying to him:^hQ Marana tha! “Our Lord, 
come!”— ( 1043 . 769 . 773 . 1043 . 2046 . 2817 1 

672 Before his Ascension Christ affirmed that the hour had not yet come for the glorious 
establishment of the messianic kingdom awaited by Israel^ which, according to the prophets, was 
to bring all men the definitive order of justice, love, and peace.According to the Lord, the 
present time is the time of the Spirit and of witness, but also a time still marked by “distress” and 
the trial of evil which does not spare the Church^hd anc [ ushers in the struggles of the last days. It is 
a time of waiting and watching.^ ( 732 . 2612 1 

The glorious advent of Christ, the hope of Israel 

673 Since the Ascension Christ’s coming in glory has been imminent,^ even though “it is not for 
you to know times or seasons which the Lather has fixed by his own authority.”^ This 
eschatological coming could be accomplished at any moment, even if both it and the final trial that 
will precede it are “delayed.”^ ( 1040 . 1048 1 

674 The glorious Messiah’s coming is suspended at every moment of history until his recognition 
by “all Israel,” for “a hardening has come upon part of Israel” in their “unbelief” toward Jesus.Z^ 
St. Peter says to the Jews of Jerusalem after Pentecost: “Repent therefore, and turn again, that your 
sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that 
he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until the time for 
establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old.”^ZQ St. Paul echoes 
him: “Lor if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean 
but life from the dead?”^Zl The “full inclusion” of the Jews in the Messiah’s salvation, in the wake 
of “the full number of the Gentiles, ”^22 will enable the People of God to achieve “the measure of 
the stature of the fullness of Christ,” in which “God may be all in all.”2Z3 (840, 58) 













The Church’s ultimate trial 


675 Before Christ’s second coming the Church must pass through a final trial that will shake the 
faith of many believers.^ The persecution that accompanies her pilgrimage on earth^S w iH unveil 
the “mystery of iniquity” in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to 
their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth. The supreme religious deception is that of the 
Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism by which man glorifies himself in place of God and of his Messiah 
come in the flesh.^ ( 769 1 

676 The Antichrist’s deception already begins to take shape in the world every time the claim is 
made to realize within history that messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history 
through the eschatalogical judgment. The Church has rejected even modified forms of this 
falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of millenarianism,^Z especially the 
“intrinsically perverse” political form of a secular messianism.^ (2425) 

677 The Church will enter the glory of the kingdom only through this final Passover, when she will 
follow her Lord in his death and Resurrection.^ The kingdom will be fulfilled, then, not by a 
historic triumph of the Church through a progressive ascendancy, but only by God’s victory over 
the final unleashing of evil, which will cause his Bride to come down from heaven.^ God’s 
triumph over the revolt of evil will take the form of the Last Judgment after the final cosmic 
upheaval of this passing world.^i ( 1340 . 2853 1 

II. To Judge the Living and the Dead 1038-1041 

678 Following in the steps of the prophets and John the Baptist, Jesus announced the judgment of 
the Last Day in his preaching.^ Then will the conduct of each one and the secrets of hearts be 
brought to light.^2 Then will the culpable unbelief that counted the offer of God’s grace as nothing 
be condemned.^ Our attitude about our neighbor will disclose acceptance or refusal of grace and 
divine love.^ On the last day Jesus will say: “Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of 
these my brethren, you did it to me.”^ (1470 ) 

679 Christ is Lord of eternal life. Full right to pass definitive judgment on the works and hearts of 
men belongs to him as redeemer of the world. He “acquired” this right by his cross. The Father has 
given “all judgment to the Son.”^Z Yet the Son did not come to judge, but to save and to give the 
life he has in himself .^8 By rejecting grace in this life, one already judges oneself, receives 
according to one’s works, and can even condemn oneself for all eternity by rejecting the Spirit of 








love.552 f lQ21 f 


IN BRIEF 

680 Christ the Lord already reigns through the Church, but all the things of this world are not yet 
subjected to him. The triumph of Christ’s kingdom will not come about without one last assault by 
the powers of evil. 

681 On Judgment Day at the end of the world, Christ will come in glory to achieve the definitive 
triumph of good over evil which, like the wheat and the tares, have grown up together in the course 
of history. 

682 When he comes at the end of time to judge the living and the dead, the glorious Christ will 
reveal the secret disposition of hearts and will render to each man according to his works and 
according to his acceptance or refusal of grace.

CHAPTER THREE: 

I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT 


683 “No one can say 'Jesus is Lord’ except by the Holy Spirit.”! “God has sent the Spirit of his Son 
into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba! Father!’”2 This knowledge of faith is possible only in the Holy 
Spirit: to be in touch with Christ, we must first have been touched by the Holy Spirit. He comes to 
meet us and kindles faith in us. By virtue of our Baptism, the first sacrament of the faith, the Holy 
Spirit in the Church communicates to us, intimately and personally, the life that originates in the 
Father and is offered to us in the Son. (424, 2670 . 152 . 249) 

Baptism gives us the grace of new birth in God the Father, through his Son, in the Holy Spirit. 
For those who bear God’s Spirit are led to the Word, that is, to the Son, and the Son presents 
them to the Father, and the Father confers incorruptibility on them. And it is impossible to see 
God’s Son without the Spirit, and no one can approach the Father without the Son, for the 
knowledge of the Father is the Son, and the knowledge of God’s Son is obtained through the 
Holy Spirit.^ 

684 Through his grace, the Holy Spirit is the first to awaken faith in us and to communicate to us 
the new life, which is to “know the Father and the one whom he has sent, Jesus Christ.”^ But the 
Spirit is the last of the persons of the Holy Trinity to be revealed. St. Gregory of Nazianzus, the 
Theologian, explains this progression in terms of the pedagogy of divine “condescension”: ( 236 ) 

The Old Testament proclaimed the Father clearly, but the Son more obscurely. The New 
Testament revealed the Son and gave us a glimpse of the divinity of the Spirit. Now the Spirit 
dwells among us and grants us a clearer vision of himself. It was not prudent, when the 
divinity of the Father had not yet been confessed, to proclaim the Son openly and, when the 
divinity of the Son was not yet admitted, to add the Holy Spirit as an extra burden, to speak 
somewhat daringly.... By advancing and progressing “from glory to glory,” the light of the 
Trinity will shine in ever more brilliant rays.S 

685 To believe in the Holy Spirit is to profess that the Holy Spirit is one of the persons of the Holy 
Trinity, consubstantial with the Father and the Son: “with the Father and the Son he is worshipped 
and glorified. ”h For this reason, the divine mystery of the Holy Spirit was already treated in the 
context of Trinitarian “theology.” Here, however, we have to do with the Holy Spirit only in the 
divine “economy.” (236) 








686 The Holy Spirit is at work with the Father and the Son from the beginning to the completion of 
the plan for our salvation. But in these “end times,” ushered in by the Son’s redeeming Incarnation, 
the Spirit is revealed and given, recognized and welcomed as a person. Now can this divine plan, 
accomplished in Christ, the firstborn and head of the new creation, be embodied in mankind by the 
outpouring of the Spirit: as the Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the 
resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. (258) 

ARTICLE 8 

“I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT” 


687 “No one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.”^ Now God’s Spirit, who 
reveals God, makes known to us Christ, his Word, his living Utterance, but the Spirit does not 
speak of himself. The Spirit who “has spoken through the prophets” makes us hear the Father’s 
Word, but we do not hear the Spirit himself. We know him only in the movement by which he 
reveals the Word to us and disposes us to welcome him in faith. The Spirit of truth who “unveils” 
Christ to us “will not speak on his own.”2 Such properly divine self-effacement explains why “the 
world cannot receive [him], because it neither sees him nor knows him,” while those who believe in 
Christ know the Spirit because he dwells with them. 2 (243) 

688 The Church, a communion living in the faith of the apostles which she transmits, is the place 
where we know the Holy Spirit: 

—in the Scriptures he inspired; 

—in the Tradition, to which the Church Fathers are always timely witnesses; 

—in the Church’s Magisterium, which he assists; 

—in the sacramental liturgy, through its words and symbols, in which the Holy Spirit puts us 
into communion with Christ; 

—in prayer, wherein he intercedes for us; 

—in the charisms and ministries by which the Church is built up; 

—in the signs of apostolic and missionary life; 

—in the witness of saints through whom he manifests his holiness and continues the work of 
salvation. 

I. The Joint Mission of the Son and the Spirit 


689 The One whom the Father has sent into our hearts, the Spirit of his Son, is truly God.i^ 






Consubstantial with the Father and the Son, the Spirit is inseparable from them, in both the inner 
life of the Trinity and his gift of love for the world. In adoring the Holy Trinity, life-giving, 
consubstantial, and indivisible, the Church’s faith also professes the distinction of persons. When 
the Father sends his Word, he always sends his Breath. In their joint mission, the Son and the Holy 
Spirit are distinct but inseparable. To be sure, it is Christ who is seen, the visible image of the 
invisible God, but it is the Spirit who reveals him. (245, 254, 485 1 

690 Jesus is Christ, “anointed,” because the Spirit is his anointing, and everything that occurs from 
the Incarnation on derives from this fullness. H When Christ is finally glorified, 12 he can in turn 
send the Spirit from his place with the Father to those who believe in him: he communicates to 
them his glory ,13 that is, the Holy Spirit who glorifies him.i^ From that time on, this joint mission 
will be manifested in the children adopted by the Father in the Body of his Son: the mission of the 
Spirit of adoption is to unite them to Christ and make them live in him: ( 436 . 788 . 448) 

The notion of anointing suggests... that there is no distance between the Son and the Spirit. 
Indeed, just as between the surface of the body and the anointing with oil neither reason nor 
sensation recognizes any intermediary, so the contact of the Son with the Spirit is immediate, 
so that anyone who would make contact with the Son by faith must first encounter the oil by 
contact. In fact there is no part that is not covered by the Holy Spirit. That is why the 
confession of the Son’s Lordship is made in the Holy Spirit by those who receive him, the 
Spirit coming from all sides to those who approach the Son in faith.13 

II. The Name, Titles, and Symbols of the Holy Spirit 

The proper name of the Holy Spirit 

691 “Holy Spirit” is the proper name of the one whom we adore and glorify with the Father and the 
Son. The Church has received this name from the Lord and professes it in the Baptism of her new 
children.!^ 

The term “Spirit” translates the Hebrew word ruah, which, in its primary sense, means breath, 
air, wind. Jesus indeed uses the sensory image of the wind to suggest to Nicodemus the 
transcendent newness of him who is personally God’s breath, the divine Spirit. 12 On the other 
hand, “Spirit” and “Holy” are divine attributes common to the three divine persons. By joining 
the two terms, Scripture, liturgy, and theological language designate the inexpressible person 
of the Holy Spirit, without any possible equivocation with other uses of the terms “spirit” and 








“holy.” 


Titles of the Holy Spirit 

692 When he proclaims and promises the coming of the Holy Spirit, Jesus calls him the 
“Paraclete,” literally, “he who is called to one’s side,” ad-vocatus .12 “Paraclete” is commonly 
translated by “consoler,” and Jesus is the first consoler.12 The Lord also called the Holy Spirit “the 
Spirit of truth. ”22 ( 1433 ) 

693 Besides the proper name of “Holy Spirit,” which is most frequently used in the Acts of the 
Apostles and in the Epistles, we also find in St. Paul the titles: the Spirit of the promise, 21 the Spirit 
of adoption, 22 the Spirit of Christ, 22 the Spirit of the Lord, 24 and the Spirit of God 25 —and, in St. 
Peter, the Spirit of glory. 25 

Symbols of the Holy Spirit 

694 Water. The symbolism of water signifies the Holy Spirit’s action in Baptism, since after the 
invocation of the Holy Spirit it becomes the efficacious sacramental sign of new birth: just as the 
gestation of our first birth took place in water, so the water of Baptism truly signifies that our birth 
into the divine life is given to us in the Holy Spirit. As “by one Spirit we were all baptized,” so we 
are also “made to drink of one Spirit.”!! Thus the Spirit is also personally the living water welling 
up from Christ crucified!^ as its source and welling up in us to eternal life.22 ( 1218 . 2652) 

695 Anointing. The symbolism of anointing with oil also signifies the Holy Spirit, 22 to the point of 
becoming a synonym for the Holy Spirit. In Christian initiation, anointing is the sacramental sign of 
Confirmation, called “chrismation” in the Churches of the East. Its full force can be grasped only in 
relation to the primary anointing accomplished by the Holy Spirit, that of Jesus. Christ (in Hebrew 
“messiah ”) means the one “anointed” by God’s Spirit. There were several anointed ones of the 
Lord in the Old Covenant, pre-eminently King David.21 But Jesus is God’s Anointed in a unique 
way: the humanity the Son assumed was entirely anointed by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit 
established him as “Christ.”22 The Virgin Mary conceived Christ by the Holy Spirit who, through 
the angel, proclaimed him the Christ at his birth, and prompted Simeon to come to the temple to see 
the Christ of the Lord.23 The Spirit filled Christ and the power of the Spirit went out from him in 
his acts of healing and of saving.24 Finally, it was the Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead.25 
Now, fully established as “Christ” in his humanity victorious over death, Jesus pours out the Holy 
Spirit abundantly until “the saints” constitute—in their union with the humanity of the Son of God 
—that perfect man “to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ”;22 “the whole Christ,” in 






St. Augustine’s expression. ( 1293 . 436 . 1504 . 794) 


696 Fire. While water signifies birth and the fruitfulness of life given in the Holy Spirit, fire 
symbolizes the transforming energy of the Holy Spirit’s actions. The prayer of the prophet Elijah, 
who “arose like fire” and whose “word burned like a torch,” brought down fire from heaven on the 
sacrifice on Mount Carmel.27 This event was a “figure” of the fire of the Holy Spirit, who 
transforms what he touches. John the Baptist, who goes “before [the Lord] in the spirit and power 
of Elijah,” proclaims Christ as the one who “will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 
Jesus will say of the Spirit: “I came to cast fire upon the earth; and would that it were already 
kindled! ”22 In the form of tongues “as of fire,” the Holy Spirit rests on the disciples on the morning 
of Pentecost and fills them with himself.42 The spiritual tradition has retained this symbolism of 
fire as one of the most expressive images of the Holy Spirit’s actions.4I “Do not quench the 
Spirit. ”42 (1127, 2586, 718 1 

697 Cloud and light These two images occur together in the manifestations of the Holy Spirit. In 
the theophanies of the Old Testament, the cloud, now obscure, now luminous, reveals the living 
and saving God, while veiling the transcendence of his glory—with Moses on Mount Sinai, 42 at the 
tent of meeting, 44 and during the wandering in the desert, 42 and with Solomon at the dedication of 
the Temple.42 In the Holy Spirit, Christ fulfills these figures. The Spirit comes upon the Virgin 
Mary and “overshadows” her, so that she might conceive and give birth to Jesus.42 On the 
mountain of Transfiguration, the Spirit in the “cloud came and overshadowed” Jesus, Moses and 
Elijah, Peter, James and John, and “a voice came out of the cloud, saying, 'This is my Son, my 
Chosen; listen to him! ’”42 Finally, the cloud took Jesus out of the sight of the disciples on the day 
of his ascension and will reveal him as Son of man in glory on the day of his final coming.42 [ 484 . 
554 . 659 1 

698 The seal is a symbol close to that of anointing. “The Father has set his seal” on Christ and also 
seals us in him.22 Because this seal indicates the indelible effect of the anointing with the Holy 
Spirit in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders, the image of the seal 
(sphragis) has been used in some theological traditions to express the indelible “character” 
imprinted by these three unrepeatable sacraments. ( 1295-1296 . 1121 ) 

699 The hand. Jesus heals the sick and blesses little children by laying hands on them.21 In his 
name the apostles will do the same.22 Even more pointedly, it is by the Apostles’ imposition of 
hands that the Holy Spirit is given.22 The Letter to the Hebrews lists the imposition of hands among 
the “fundamental elements” of its teaching.24 The Church has kept this sign of the all-powerful 














outpouring of the Holy Spirit in its sacramental epicleses. (292, 1288 . 1300 . 1573 . 1668 1 


700 The finger. “It is by the finger of God that [Jesus] cast out demons.”^ If God’s law was written 
on tablets of stone “by the finger of God,” then the “letter from Christ” entrusted to the care of the 
apostles, is written “with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of 
human hearts.”^ The hymn Veni Creator Spiritus invokes the Holy Spirit as the “finger of the 
Father’s right hand '.”5? (2056) 

701 The dove. At the end of the flood, whose symbolism refers to Baptism, a dove released by 
Noah returns with a fresh olive-tree branch in its beak as a sign that the earth was again 
habitable.^ When Christ comes up from the water of his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the form of a 
dove, comes down upon him and remains with him.^H The Spirit comes down and remains in the 
purified hearts of the baptized. In certain churches, the Eucharist is reserved in a metal receptacle in 
the form of a dove ( columbarium ) suspended above the altar. Christian iconography traditionally 
uses a dove to suggest the Spirit. ( 1219 . 535 1

III. God’s Spirit and Word in the Time of the Promises 

702 From the beginning until “the fullness of time,”S0 the joint mission of the Father’s Word and 
Spirit remains hidden, but it is at work. God’s Spirit prepares for the time of the Messiah. Neither is 
fully revealed but both are already promised, to be watched for and welcomed at their 
manifestation. So, for this reason, when the Church reads the Old Testament, she searches there for 
what the Spirit, “who has spoken through the prophets,” wants to tell us about Christ.^ (122, 107 . 
243) 

By “prophets” the faith of the Church here understands all whom the Holy Spirit inspired in 
living proclamation and in the composition of the sacred books, both of the Old and the New 
Testaments. Jewish tradition distinguishes first the Faw (the five first books or Pentateuch), then 
the Prophets (our historical and prophetic books) and finally the Writings (especially the wisdom 
literature, in particular the Psalms).^ 

In creation 

703 The Word of God and his Breath are at the origin of the being and life of every creature:^ 
( 292 . 291) 







It belongs to the Holy Spirit to rule, sanctify, and animate creation, for he is God, 
consubstantial with the Father and the Son.... Power over life pertains to the Spirit, for being 
God he preserves creation in the Father through the Son.^ 

704 “God fashioned man with his own hands [that is, the Son and the Holy Spirit] and impressed 
his own form on the flesh he had fashioned, in such a way that even what was visible might bear 
the divine form.”h2&gt; ( 356 ) 

The Spirit of the promise 

705 Disfigured by sin and death, man remains “in the image of God,” in the image of the Son, but 
is deprived “of the glory of God,”§§ of his “likeness.” The promise made to Abraham inaugurates 
the economy of salvation, at the culmination of which the Son himself will assume that “image”§2 
and restore it in the Father’s “likeness” by giving it again its Glory, the Spirit who is “the giver of 
life.” (410, 2809 1 

706 Against all human hope, God promises descendants to Abraham, as the fruit of faith and of the 
power of the Holy Spirit.^ In Abraham’s progeny all the nations of the earth will be blessed. This 
progeny will be Christ himself,in whom the outpouring of the Holy Spirit will “gather into one 
the children of God who are scattered abroad.”^ God commits himself by his own solemn oath to 
giving his beloved Son and “the promised Holy Spirit... [who is] the guarantee of our inheritance 
until we acquire possession of it. ”21 (60) 

In Theophanies and the Law 

707 Theophanies (manifestations of God) light up the way of the promise, from the patriarchs to 
Moses and from Joshua to the visions that inaugurated the missions of the great prophets. Christian 
tradition has always recognized that God’s Word allowed himself to be seen and heard in these 
theophanies, in which the cloud of the Holy Spirit both revealed him and concealed him in its 
shadow. 

708 This divine pedagogy appears especially in the gift of the Law.22 God gave the Law as a 
“pedagogue” to lead his people towards Christ.24 But the Law’s powerlessness to save man 
deprived of the divine “likeness,” along with the growing awareness of sin that it imparts,24 
enkindles a desire for the Holy Spirit. The lamentations of the Psalms bear witness to this. ( 1961- 
1964 . 122 . 2585 1 









In the Kingdom and the Exile 


709 The Law, the sign of God’s promise and covenant, ought to have governed the hearts and 
institutions of that people to whom Abraham’s faith gave birth. “If you will obey my voice and 
keep my covenant,... you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.”^ But after David, 
Israel gave in to the temptation of becoming a kingdom like other nations. The Kingdom, however, 
the object of the promise made to David,would be the work of the Holy Spirit; it would belong to 
the poor according to the Spirit. 1 2579 . 544 ) 

710 The forgetting of the Law and the infidelity to the covenant end in death: it is the Exile, 
apparently the failure of the promises, which is in fact the mysterious fidelity of the Savior God and 
the beginning of a promised restoration, but according to the Spirit. The People of God had to 
suffer this purification,^ In God’s plan, the Exile already stands in the shadow of the Cross, and 
the Remnant of the poor that returns from the Exile is one of the most transparent prefigurations of 
the Church. 

Expectation of the Messiah and his Spirit 

711 “Behold, I am doing a new thing.Two prophetic lines were to develop, one leading to the 
expectation of the Messiah, the other pointing to the announcement of a new Spirit. They converge 
in the small Remnant, the people of the poor, who await in hope the “consolation of Israel” and 
“the redemption of Jerusalem.”^ (64, 522) 

We have seen earlier how Jesus fulfills the prophecies concerning himself. We limit ourselves 
here to those in which the relationship of the Messiah and his Spirit appears more clearly. 

712 The characteristics of the awaited Messiah begin to appear in the “Book of Emmanuel” 
(“Isaiah said this when he saw his glory, speaking of Christ), especially in the first two verses of 
Isaiah 11: (439) 

There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, 
and a branch shall grow out of his roots. 

And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, 

the spirit of wisdom and understanding, 

the spirit of counsel and might, 

the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD. SI 

713 The Messiah’s characteristics are revealed above all in the “Servant songs.These songs 






proclaim the meaning of Jesus’ Passion and show how he will pour out the Holy Spirit to give life 
to the many: not as an outsider, but by embracing our “form as slave. ”23 Taking our death upon 
himself, he can communicate to us his own Spirit of life. (601) 

714 This is why Christ inaugurates the proclamation of the Good News by making his own the 
following passage from Isaiah:^ 

The Spirit of the LORD God is upon me, 

because the LORD has anointed me 

to bring good tidings to the afflicted; 

he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted, 

to proclaim liberty to the captives, 

and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; 

to proclaim the year of the LORD’S favor. 

715 The prophetic texts that directly concern the sending of the Holy Spirit are oracles by which 
God speaks to the heart of his people in the language of the promise, with the accents of “love and 
fidelity.”^ St. Peter will proclaim their fulfillment on the morning of Pentecost.^ According to 
these promises, at the “end time” the Lord’s Spirit will renew the hearts of men, engraving a new 
law in them. He will gather and reconcile the scattered and divided peoples; he will transform the 
first creation, and God will dwell there with men in peace. ( 214 . 1965 1 

716 The People of the “poor”22— those who, humble and meek, rely solely on their God’s 
mysterious plans, who await the justice, not of men but of the Messiah—are in the end the great 
achievement of the Holy Spirit’s hidden mission during the time of the promises that prepare for 
Christ’s coming. It is this quality of heart, purified and enlightened by the Spirit, which is 
expressed in the Psalms. In these poor, the Spirit is making ready “a people prepared for the 
Lord.”— (368)

IV. The Spirit of Christ in the Fullness of Time 

John, precursor, prophet, and baptist 

717 “There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.”22 John was “filled with the Holy 
Spirit even from his mother’s womb”22 by Christ himself, whom the Virgin Mary had just 
conceived by the Holy Spirit. Mary’s visitation to Elizabeth thus became a visit from God to his 
people.^! (523) 

718 John is “Elijah [who] must come. ”22 The fire of the Spirit dwells in him and makes him the 
forerunner of the coming Lord. In John, the precursor, the Holy Spirit completes the work of 
“[making] ready a people prepared for the Lord.”23 [ 696 1 

719 John the Baptist is “more than a prophet.”2d In him, the Holy Spirit concludes his speaking 
through the prophets. John completes the cycle of prophets begun by Elijah.22 He proclaims the 
imminence of the consolation of Israel; he is the “voice” of the Consoler who is coming.22 As the 
Spirit of truth will also do, John “came to bear witness to the light.”2Z In John’s sight, the Spirit 
thus brings to completion the careful search of the prophets and fulfills the longing of the angels. 22 
“He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. 
And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.... Behold, the Lamb of God.”22 
(2684, 536 1 

720 Finally, with John the Baptist, the Holy Spirit begins the restoration to man of “the divine 
likeness,” prefiguring what he would achieve with and in Christ. John’s baptism was for 
repentance; baptism in water and the Spirit will be a new birth.122 ( 535 ) 







“Rejoice, you who are full of grace” 


721 Mary, the all-holy ever-virgin Mother of God, is the masterwork of the mission of the Son and 
the Spirit in the fullness of time. For the first time in the plan of salvation and because his Spirit 
had prepared her, the Father found the dwelling place where his Son and his Spirit could dwell 
among men. In this sense the Church’s Tradition has often read the most beautiful texts on wisdom 
in relation to Mary.lQi Mary is acclaimed and represented in the liturgy as the “Seat of Wisdom.” 
(484) 

In her, the “wonders of God” that the Spirit was to fulfill in Christ and the Church began to be 
manifested: 

722 The Holy Spirit prepared Mary by his grace. It was fitting that the mother of him in whom “the 
whole fullness of deity dwells bodily”^ should herself be “full of grace.” She was, by sheer grace, 
conceived without sin as the most humble of creatures, the most capable of welcoming the 
inexpressible gift of the Almighty. It was quite correct for the angel Gabriel to greet her as the 
“Daughter of Zion”: “Rejoice.”^ it [ s the thanksgiving of the whole People of God, and thus of 
the Church, which Mary in her canticlel^ lifts up to the Father in the Holy Spirit while carrying 
within her the eternal Son. (489, 2676 1 

723 In Mary, the Holy Spirit fulfills the plan of the Father’s loving goodness. Through the Holy 
Spirit, the Virgin conceives and gives birth to the Son of God. By the Holy Spirit’s power and her 
faith, her virginity became uniquely fruitful.^ ( 485 . 506 ) 

724 In Mary, the Holy Spirit manifests the Son of the Father, now become the Son of the Virgin. 
She is the burning bush of the definitive theophany. Filled with the Holy Spirit she makes the Word 
visible in the humility of his flesh. It is to the poor and the first representatives of the gentiles that 
she makes him known. 1^ ( 963 ) 

725 Finally, through Mary, the Holy Spirit begins to bring men, the objects of God’s merciful 
love,10Z into communion with Christ. And the humble are always the first to accept him: shepherds, 
magi, Simeon and Anna, the bride and groom at Cana, and the first disciples. (208, 2619 ) 

726 At the end of this mission of the Spirit, Mary became the Woman, the new Eve (“mother of the 
living”), the mother of the “whole Christ.”^ As such, she was present with the Twelve, who “with 
one accord devoted themselves to prayer, ”1^9 a t the dawn of the “end time” which the Spirit was to 
inaugurate on the morning of Pentecost with the manifestation of the Church. ( 494 . 2618 ) 












Christ Jesus 


727 The entire mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit, in the fullness of time, is contained in this: 
that the Son is the one anointed by the Father’s Spirit since his Incarnation—Jesus is the Christ, the 
Messiah. (438, 695, 536) 

Everything in the second chapter of the Creed is to be read in this light. Christ’s whole work is 
in fact a joint mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Here, we shall mention only what has to do 
with Jesus’ promise of the Holy Spirit and the gift of him by the glorified Lord. 

728 Jesus does not reveal the Holy Spirit fully, until he himself has been glorified through his 
Death and Resurrection. Nevertheless, little by little he alludes to him even in his teaching of the 
multitudes, as when he reveals that his own flesh will be food for the life of the world.H^ He also 
alludes to the Spirit in speaking to Nicodemus,lU to the Samaritan woman,HI anc [ t0 those who 
take part in the feast of Tabernacles.^ To his disciples he speaks openly of the Spirit in 
connection with prayeri-Ld anc [ w ith the witness they will have to bear.Hl (2615) 

729 Only when the hour has arrived for his glorification does Jesus promise the coming of the Holy 
Spirit, since his Death and Resurrection will fulfill the promise made to the fathers.!^ The Spirit of 
truth, the other Paraclete, will be given by the Father in answer to Jesus’ prayer; he will be sent by 
the Father in Jesus’ name; and Jesus will send him from the Father’s side, since he comes from the 
Father. The Holy Spirit will come and we shall know him; he will be with us for ever; he will 
remain with us. The Spirit will teach us everything, remind us of all that Christ said to us and bear 
witness to him. The Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth and will glorify Christ. He will prove the 
world wrong about sin, righteousness, and judgment. (388, 1433 1 

730 At last Jesus’ hour arrives he commends his spirit into the Father’s handsll^ at the very 
moment when by his death he conquers death, so that, “raised from the dead by the glory of the 
Father, he might immediately give the Holy Spirit by “breathing” on his disciples.Hf 1 From this 
hour onward, the mission of Christ and the Spirit becomes the mission of the Church: “As the 
Father has sent me, even so I send you.”Hi (850) 

V. The Spirit and the Church in the Last Days 

Pentecost 

731 On the day of Pentecost when the seven weeks of Easter had come to an end, Christ’s Passover 
is fulfilled in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, manifested, given, and communicated as a divine 









person: of his fullness, Christ, the Lord, pours out the Spirit in abundance.!^ ( 2623 . 767 . 1302 1 


732 On that day, the Holy Trinity is fully revealed. Since that day, the Kingdom announced by 
Christ has been open to those who believe in him: in the humility of the flesh and in faith, they 
already share in the communion of the Holy Trinity. By his coming, which never ceases, the Holy 
Spirit causes the world to enter into the “last days,” the time of the Church, the Kingdom already 
inherited though not yet consummated. (244, 672 1 

We have seen the true Light, we have received the heavenly Spirit, we have found the true 
faith: we adore the indivisible Trinity, who has saved us.— 

The Holy Spirit — God’s gift 

733 “God is Love”i24 and love is his first gift, containing all others. “God’s love has been poured 
into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”i^ ( 218 1 

734 Because we are dead or at least wounded through sin, the first effect of the gift of love is the 
forgiveness of our sins. The communion of the Holy Spirit^? in the Church restores to the baptized 
the divine likeness lost through sin. (1987) 

735 He, then, gives us the “pledge” or “first fruits” of our inheritance: the very life of the Holy 
Trinity, which is to love as “God [has] loved us.”i^2 This love (the “charity” of 1 Cor 13) is the 
source of the new life in Christ, made possible because we have received “power” from the Holy 

Spirit.^ ( 1822 1 

736 By this power of the Spirit, God’s children can bear much fruit. He who has grafted us onto the 
true vine will make us bear “the fruit of the Spirit:... love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, 
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.”^ “We live by the Spirit”; the more we renounce ourselves, 
the more we “walk by the Spirit.”^ ( 1832 1 

Through the Holy Spirit we are restored to paradise, led back to the Kingdom of heaven, and 
adopted as children, given confidence to call God “Father” and to share in Christ’s grace, 
called children of light and given a share in eternal glory.l^i 

The Holy Spirit and the Church 

737 The mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit is brought to completion in the Church, which is the 
Body of Christ and the Temple of the Holy Spirit. This joint mission henceforth brings Christ’s 











faithful to share in his communion with the Father in the Holy Spirit. The Spirit prepares men and 
goes out to them with his grace, in order to draw them to Christ. The Spirit manifests the risen Lord 
to them, recalls his word to them and opens their minds to the understanding of his Death and 
Resurrection. He makes present the mystery of Christ, supremely in the Eucharist, in order to 
reconcile them, to bring them into communion with God, that they may “bear much fruit.”122 ( 787- 
798 . 1093-1109 1 

738 Thus the Church’s mission is not an addition to that of Christ and the Holy Spirit, but is its 
sacrament: in her whole being and in all her members, the Church is sent to announce, bear witness, 
make present, and spread the mystery of the communion of the Holy Trinity (the topic of the next 
article): (850, 777 ) 

All of us who have received one and the same Spirit, that is, the Holy Spirit, are in a sense 
blended together with one another and with God. For if Christ, together with the Father’s and 
his own Spirit, comes to dwell in each of us, though we are many, still the Spirit is one and 
undivided. He binds together the spirits of each and every one of us,... and makes all appear as 
one in him. For just as the power of Christ’s sacred flesh unites those in whom it dwells into 
one body, I think that in the same way the one and undivided Spirit of God, who dwells in all, 
leads all into spiritual unity.^2 

739 Because the Holy Spirit is the anointing of Christ, it is Christ who, as the head of the Body, 
pours out the Spirit among his members to nourish, heal, and organize them in their mutual 
functions, to give them life, send them to bear witness, and associate them to his self-offering to the 
Father and to his intercession for the whole world. Through the Church’s sacraments, Christ 
communicates his Holy and sanctifying Spirit to the members of his Body. (This will be the topic 
of Part Two of the Catechism.) ( 1076 ) 

740 These “mighty works of God,” offered to believers in the sacraments of the Church, bear their 
fruit in the new life in Christ, according to the Spirit. (This will be the topic of Part Three.) 

741 “The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the 
Spirit himself intercedes with sighs too deep for words.”1^4 The Holy Spirit, the artisan of God’s 
works, is the master of prayer. (This will be the topic of Part Four.) 


IN BRIEF 











742 “Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba! 
Father!’” (Gal 4:6). 

743 From the beginning to the end of time, whenever God sends his Son, he always sends his 
Spirit: their mission is conjoined and inseparable. 

744 In the fullness of time the Holy Spirit completes in Mary all the preparations for Christ’s 
coming among the People of God. By the action of the Holy Spirit in her, the Father gives the 
world Emmanuel, “God-with-us” (Mt 1:23). 

745 The Son of God was consecrated as Christ (Messiah) by the anointing of the Holy Spirit at his 
Incarnation (cf. Ps 2:6-7). 

746 By his Death and his Resurrection, Jesus is constituted in glory as Lord and Christ (cf. Acts 
2:36). From his fullness, he poured out the Holy Spirit on the apostles and the Church. 

747 The Holy Spirit, whom Christ the head pours out on his members, builds, animates, and 
sanctifies the Church. She is the sacrament of the Holy Trinity’s communion with men.

ARTICLE 9 

“I BELIEVE IN THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH” 


748 “Christ is the light of humanity; and it is, accordingly, the heart-felt desire of this sacred 
Council, being gathered together in the Holy Spirit, that, by proclaiming his Gospel to every 




creature, it may bring to all men that light of Christ which shines out visibly from the Church.”!^ 
These words open the Second Vatican Council’s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church. By 
choosing this starting point, the Council demonstrates that the article of faith about the Church 
depends entirely on the articles concerning Christ Jesus. The Church has no other light than 
Christ’s; according to a favorite image of the Church Fathers, the Church is like the moon, all its 
light reflected from the sun. 

749 The article concerning the Church also depends entirely on the article about the Holy Spirit, 
which immediately precedes it. “Indeed, having shown that the Spirit is the source and giver of ah 
holiness, we now confess that it is he who has endowed the Church with holiness. ”12§ The Church 
is, in a phrase used by the Fathers, the place “where the Spirit flourishes. ”142 

750 To believe that the Church is “holy” and “catholic,” and that she is “one” and “apostolic” (as 
the Nicene Creed adds), is inseparable from belief in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. 
In the Apostles’ Creed we profess “one Holy Church” ( Credo ... Ecclesiam ), and not to believe in 
the Church, so as not to confuse God with his works and to attribute clearly to God’s goodness all 
the gifts he has bestowed on his Church.142 (811, 169 1 

Paragraph 1. The Church in God’s Plan 
I. Names and Images of the Church 


751 The word “Church” (Latin ecclesia, from the Greek ek-kalein, to “call out of”) means a 
convocation or an assembly. It designates the assemblies of the people, usually for a religious 
purpose.142 Ekklesia is used frequently in the Greek Old Testament for the assembly of the Chosen 
People before God, above all for their assembly on Mount Sinai where Israel received the Law and 
was established by God as his holy people.142 By calling itself “Church,” the first community of 
Christian believers recognized itself as heir to that assembly. In the Church, God is “calling 
together” his people from ah the ends of the earth. The equivalent Greek term Kyriak, from which 
the English word Church and the German Kirche are derived, means “what belongs to the Lord.” 

752 In Christian usage, the word “church” designates the liturgical assembly, 14! but also the local 
communityl42 or the whole universal community of believers. 142 These three meanings are 
inseparable. “The Church” is the People that God gathers in the whole world. She exists in local 
communities and is made real as a liturgical, above ah a Eucharistic, assembly. She draws her life 
from the word and the Body of Christ and so herself becomes Christ’s Body. ( 1140 . 832 . 830 1 







Symbols of the Church 


753 In Scripture, we find a host of interrelated images and figures through which Revelation speaks 
of the inexhaustible mystery of the Church. The images taken from the Old Testament are 
variations on a profound theme: the People of God. In the New Testament, all these images find a 
new center because Christ has become the head of this people, which henceforth is his Body.H4 
Around this center are grouped images taken “from the life of the shepherd or from cultivation of 
the land, from the art of building or from family life and marriage. (Z81, 789 1 

754 “The Church is, accordingly, a sheepfold, the sole and necessary gateway to which is Christ. It 
is also the flock of which God himself foretold that he would be the shepherd, and whose sheep, 
even though governed by human shepherds, are unfailingly nourished and led by Christ himself, the 
Good Shepherd and Prince of Shepherds, who gave his life for his sheep. ^ (857) 

755 “The Church is a cultivated field, the tillage of God. On that land the ancient olive tree grows 
whose holy roots were the prophets and in which the reconciliation of Jews and Gentiles has been 
brought about and will be brought about again. That land, like a choice vineyard, has been planted 
by the heavenly cultivator. Yet the true vine is Christ who gives life and fruitfulness to the 
branches, that is, to us, who through the Church remain in Christ, without whom we can do 
nothing. HZ ( 795 1 

756 “Often, too, the Church is called the building of God. The Lord compared himself to the stone 
which the builders rejected, but which was made into the corner-stone. On this foundation the 
Church is built by the apostles and from it the Church receives solidity and unity. This edifice has 
many names to describe it: the house of God in which his family dwells; the household of God in 
the Spirit; the dwelling-place of God among men; and, especially, the holy temple. This temple, 
symbolized in places of worship built out of stone, is praised by the Fathers and, not without 
reason, is compared in the liturgy to the Holy City, the New Jerusalem. As living stones we here on 
earth are built into it. It is this holy city that is seen by John as it comes down out of heaven from 
God when the world is made anew, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.HS (797, 857 . 
1045 1 

757 “The Church, further, which is called That Jerusalem which is above’ and ‘our mother,’ is 
described as the spotless spouse of the spotless lamb. It is she whom Christ ‘loved and for whom he 
delivered himself up that he might sanctify her.’ It is she whom he unites to himself by an 
unbreakable alliance, and whom he constantly ‘nourishes and cherishes. ”’H9 (507, Z96, 1616 ) 












II. The Church’s Origin, Foundation, and Mission 


758 We begin our investigation of the Church’s mystery by meditating on her origin in the Holy 
Trinity’s plan and her progressive realization in history. (257) 

A plan born in the Father’s heart 

759 “The eternal Father, in accordance with the utterly gratuitous and mysterious design of his 
wisdom and goodness, created the whole universe and chose to raise up men to share in his own 
divine life, ”1^2 to which he calls all men in his Son. “The Father... determined to call together in a 
holy Church those who should believe in Christ.”^ This “family of God” is gradually formed and 
takes shape during the stages of human history, in keeping with the Father’s plan. In fact, “already 
present in figure at the beginning of the world, this Church was prepared in marvellous fashion in 
the history of the people of Israel and the old Alliance. Established in this last age of the world and 
made manifest in the outpouring of the Spirit, it will be brought to glorious completion at the end of 
time. ”1^2 (293, 1655 1 

The Church—foreshadowed from the world’s beginning 

760 Christians of the first centuries said, “The world was created for the sake of the Church.”^ 
God created the world for the sake of communion with his divine life, a communion brought about 
by the “convocation” of men in Christ, and this “convocation” is the Church. The Church is the 
goal of all things,^ and God permitted such painful upheavals as the angels’ fall and man’s sin 
only as occasions and means for displaying all the power of his arm and the whole measure of the 
love he wanted to give the world: ( 294 . 309 ) 

Just as God’s will is creation and is called “the world,” so his intention is the salvation of men, 
and it is called “the Church.”^ 

The Church—prepared for in the Old Covenant 

761 The gathering together of the People of God began at the moment when sin destroyed the 
communion of men with God, and that of men among themselves. The gathering together of the 
Church is, as it were, God’s reaction to the chaos provoked by sin. This reunification is achieved 
secretly in the heart of all peoples: “In every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is 
acceptable” to God.i^ (55) 







762 The remote preparation for this gathering together of the People of God begins when he calls 
Abraham and promises that he will become the father of a great people.HZ its immediate 
preparation begins with Israel’s election as the People of God. By this election, Israel is to be the 
sign of the future gathering of all nations.133 But the prophets accuse Israel of breaking the 
covenant and behaving like a prostitute. They announce a new and eternal covenant. “Christ 
instituted this New Covenant.”!^ (122, 522, 60, 64)

The Church—instituted by Christ Jesus 

763 It was the Son’s task to accomplish the Father’s plan of salvation in the fullness of time. Its 
accomplishment was the reason for his being sent.±T2 “The Lord Jesus inaugurated his Church by 
preaching the Good News, that is, the coming of the Reign of God, promised over the ages in the 
scriptures. ”±1± To fulfill the Father’s will, Christ ushered in the Kingdom of heaven on earth. The 
Church “is the Reign of Christ already present in mystery. ”±T2 ( 541 ) 

764 “This Kingdom shines out before men in the word, in the works and in the presence of 
Christ.”±T± To welcome Jesus’ word is to welcome “the Kingdom itself.”±T± The seed and 
beginning of the Kingdom are the “little flock” of those whom Jesus came to gather around him, 
the flock whose shepherd he is.lhT They form Jesus’ true family.ihh To those whom he thus 
gathered around him, he taught a new “way of acting” and a prayer of their own.±T7 ( 543 . 1691 . 
2558 1 


765 The Lord Jesus endowed his community with a structure that will remain until the Kingdom is 






fully achieved. Before all else there is the choice of the Twelve with Peter as their head.J^ 
Representing the twelve tribes of Israel, they are the foundation stones of the new Jerusalem.!^ 
The Twelve and the other disciples share in Christ’s mission and his power, but also in his lot.^2 
By all his actions, Christ prepares and builds his Church. (610, 551) 

766 The Church is born primarily of Christ’s total self-giving for our salvation, anticipated in the 
institution of the Eucharist and fulfilled on the cross. “The origin and growth of the Church are 
symbolized by the blood and water which flowed from the open side of the crucified Jesus. ”1^1 
“For it was from the side of Christ as he slept the sleep of death upon the cross that there came 
forth the ‘wondrous sacrament of the whole Church. ”’U2 As Eve was formed from the sleeping 
Adam’s side, so the Church was born from the pierced heart of Christ hanging dead on the cross.i^ 
(813, 860,134Q, 617, 478 1 

The Church—revealed by the Holy Spirit 

767 “When the work which the Father gave the Son to do on earth was accomplished, the Holy 
Spirit was sent on the day of Pentecost in order that he might continually sanctify the Church.”1^4 
Then “the Church was openly displayed to the crowds and the spread of the Gospel among the 
nations, through preaching, was begun.”!^ As the “convocation” of all men for salvation, the 
Church in her very nature is missionary, sent by Christ to all the nations to make disciples of 
them (731, 849 1 

768 So that she can fulfill her mission, the Holy Spirit “bestows upon [the Church] varied 
hierarchic and charismatic gifts, and in this way directs her.”122 “Henceforward the Church, 
endowed with the gifts of her founder and faithfully observing his precepts of charity, humility and 
self-denial, receives the mission of proclaiming and establishing among all peoples the Kingdom of 
Christ and of God, and she is on earth the seed and the beginning of that kingdom.”!^ ( 541 1 

The Church—perfected in glory 

769 “The Church... will receive its perfection only in the glory of heaven,”!^ a t the time of 
Christ’s glorious return. Until that day, “the Church progresses on her pilgrimage amidst this 
world’s persecutions and God’s consolations.”^ Here below she knows that she is in exile far 
from the Lord, and longs for the full coming of the Kingdom, when she will “be united in glory 
with her king.”d£i The Church, and through her the world, will not be perfected in glory without 
great trials. Only then will “all the just from the time of Adam, ‘from Abel, the just one, to the last 
of the elect,’... be gathered together in the universal Church in the Father’s presence.”!^ [ 671 .

III. The Mystery of the Church 


770 The Church is in history, but at the same time she transcends it. It is only “with the eyes of 
faith”182 that one can see her in her visible reality and at the same time in her spiritual reality as 
bearer of divine life. 1 812 1 

The Church—both visible and spiritual 

771 “The one mediator, Christ, established and ever sustains here on earth his holy Church, the 
community of faith, hope, and charity, as a visible organization through which he communicates 
truth and grace to all men.”184 The Church is at the same time: ( 827 . 1880 . 954 1 

—a “society structured with hierarchical organs and the mystical body of Christ; 

—the visible society and the spiritual community; 

—the earthly Church and the Church endowed with heavenly riches.”185 
These dimensions together constitute “one complex reality which comes together from a 
human and a divine element”: 188 

The Church is essentially both human and divine, visible but endowed with invisible realities, 
zealous in action and dedicated to contemplation, present in the world, but as a pilgrim, so 
constituted that in her the human is directed toward and subordinated to the divine, the visible 
to the invisible, action to contemplation, and this present world to that city yet to come, the 
object of our quest. 182 

O humility! O sublimity! Both tabernacle of cedar and sanctuary of God; earthly dwelling and 
celestial palace; house of clay and royal hall; body of death and temple of light; and at last 
both object of scorn to the proud and bride of Christ! She is black but beautiful, O daughters 






of Jerusalem, for even if the labor and pain of her long exile may have discolored her, yet 
heaven’s beauty has adorned her .222 

The Church—mystery of man’s union with God 

111 It is in the Church that Christ fulfills and reveals his own mystery as the purpose of God’s plan: 
“to unite all things in him.”129 St. Paul calls the nuptial union of Christ and the Church “a great 
mystery.” Because she is united to Christ as to her bridegroom, she becomes a mystery in her 
turn.22Q Contemplating this mystery in her, Paul exclaims: “Christ in you, the hope of glory. ”121 
1 518 . 796 1 

773 In the Church this communion of men with God, in the “love [that] never ends,” is the purpose 
which governs everything in her that is a sacramental means, tied to this passing world.122 “[The 
Church’s] structure is totally ordered to the holiness of Christ’s members. And holiness is measured 
according to the 'great mystery’ in which the Bride responds with the gift of love to the gift of the 
Bridegroom.”123 Mary goes before us all in the holiness that is the Church’s mystery as “the bride 
without spot or wrinkle. ”124 This is why the “Marian” dimension of the Church precedes the 
“Petrine. ”122 (6Z1, 972 1 

The universal Sacrament of Salvation 

774 The Greek word mysterion was translated into Latin by two terms: mysterium and 
sacramentum. In later usage the term sacramentum emphasizes the visible sign of the hidden reality 
of salvation which was indicated by the term mysterium. In this sense, Christ himself is the mystery 
of salvation: “For there is no other mystery of God, except Christ.”122 The saving work of his holy 
and sanctifying humanity is the sacrament of salvation, which is revealed and active in the 
Church’s sacraments (which the Eastern Churches also call “the holy mysteries”). The seven 
sacraments are the signs and instruments by which the Holy Spirit spreads the grace of Christ the 
head throughout the Church which is his Body. The Church, then, both contains and communicates 
the invisible grace she signifies. It is in this analogical sense, that the Church is called a 
“sacrament.” (1QZ5, 515, 2014, 1116 1 

775 “The Church, in Christ, is like a sacrament—a sign and instrument, that is, of communion with 
God and of unity among all men.”12/ The Church’s first purpose is to be the sacrament of [ 360 ] 
the inner union of men with God. Because men’s communion with one another is rooted in that 
union with God, the Church is also the sacrament of the unity of the human race. In her, this unity 
is already begun, since she gathers men “from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and 











tongues”;!^ a t the same time, the Church is the “sign and instrument” of the full realization of the 
unity yet to come. 

776 As sacrament, the Church is Christ’s instrument. “She is taken up by him also as the instrument 
for the salvation of all,” “the universal sacrament of salvation,” by which Christ is “at once 
manifesting and actualizing the mystery of God’s love for men.”l^ The Church “is the visible plan 
of God’s love for humanity,” because God desires “that the whole human race may become one 
People of God, form one Body of Christ, and be built up into one temple of the Holy Spirit.”^ 
( 1088 ) 


IN BRIEF 


777 The word “Church” means “convocation.” It designates the assembly of those whom God’s 
Word “convokes,” i.e., gathers together to form the People of God, and who themselves, nourished 
with the Body of Christ, become the Body of Christ. 

778 The Church is both the means and the goal of God’s plan: prefigured in creation, prepared for 
in the Old Covenant, founded by the words and actions of Jesus Christ, fulfilled by his redeeming 
cross and his Resurrection, the Church has been manifested as the mystery of salvation by the 
outpouring of the Holy Spirit. She will be perfected in the glory of heaven as the assembly of all the 
redeemed of the earth (cf. Rev 14:4). 

779 The Church is both visible and spiritual, a hierarchical society and the Mystical Body of Christ. 
She is one, yet formed of two components, human and divine. That is her mystery, which only faith 
can accept. 

780 The Church in this world is the sacrament of salvation, the sign and the instrument of the 
communion of God and men.

Paragraph 2. The Church—People of God, Body of Christ, Temple of the Holy Spirit 
I. The Church—People of God 

781 “At all times and in every race, anyone who fears God and does what is right has been 
acceptable to him. He has, however, willed to make men holy and save them, not as individuals 
without any bond or link between them, but rather to make them into a people who might 


acknowledge him and serve him in holiness. He therefore chose the Israelite race to be his own 
people and established a covenant with it. He gradually instructed this people.... All these things, 
however, happened as a preparation for and figure of that new and perfect covenant which was to 
be ratified in Christ... the New Covenant in his blood; he called together a race made up of Jews 
and Gentiles which would be one, not according to the flesh, but in the Spirit.”22i 

Characteristics of the People of God 

782 The People of God is marked by characteristics that clearly distinguish it from all other 
religious, ethnic, political, or cultural groups found in history: (871, 2787 . 1267 . 695 . 1741 . 1972 . 
849 . 769 1 

—It is the People of God: God is not the property of any one people. But he acquired a people 
for himself from those who previously were not a people: “a chosen race, a royal 
priesthood, a holy nation.”222 

—One becomes a member of this people not by a physical birth, but by being “born anew,” a 
birth “of water and the Spirit, ”223 that is, by faith in Christ, and Baptism. 

—This People has for its Head Jesus the Christ (the anointed, the Messiah). Because the same 
anointing, the Holy Spirit, flows from the head into the body, this is “the messianic 
people.” 

— “The status of this people is that of the dignity and freedom of the sons of God, in whose 

hearts the Holy Spirit dwells as in a temple.” 

— “Its law is the new commandment to love as Christ loved us. ”224 This is the “new” law of 

the Holy Spirit.225 

—Its mission is to be salt of the earth and light of the world.222 This people is “a most sure 
seed of unity, hope, and salvation for the whole human race.” 

—Its destiny, finally, “is the Kingdom of God which has been begun by God himself on earth 
and which must be further extended until it has been brought to perfection by him at the 
end of time.”22Z 

A priestly, prophetic, and royal people 

783 Jesus Christ is the one whom the Father anointed with the Holy Spirit and established as priest, 
prophet, and king. The whole People of God participates in these three offices of Christ and bears 
the responsibilities for mission and service that flow from them.22B ( 436 . 873 1 


784 On entering the People of God through faith and Baptism, one receives a share in this people’s 












unique, priestly vocation: “Christ the Lord, high priest taken from among men, has made this new 
people ‘a kingdom of priests to God, his Father.’ The baptized, by regeneration and the anointing of 
the Holy Spirit, are consecrated to be a spiritual house and a holy priesthood.”^ ( 1268 . 1546 1 

785 “The holy People of God shares also in Christ’s prophetic office,” above all in the supernatural 
sense of faith that belongs to the whole People, lay and clergy, when it “unfailingly adheres to this 
faith... once for all delivered to the saints,”^ and when it deepens its understanding and becomes 
Christ’s witness in the midst of this world. (92) 

786 Finally, the People of God shares in the royal office of Christ. He exercises his kingship by 
drawing all men to himself through his death and Resurrection.^ Christ, King and Lord of the 
universe, made himself the servant of all, for he came “not to be served but to serve, and to give his 
life as a ransom for many.”^12 For the Christian, “to reign is to serve him,” particularly when 
serving “the poor and the suffering, in whom the Church recognizes the image of her poor and 
suffering founder.”^ The People of God fulfills its royal dignity by a life in keeping with its 
vocation to serve with Christ. (2449, 2443 1 

The sign of the cross makes kings of all those reborn in Christ and the anointing of the Holy 
Spirit consecrates them as priests, so that, apart from the particular service of our ministry, all 
spiritual and rational Christians are recognized as members of this royal race and sharers in 
Christ’s priestly office. What, indeed, is as royal for a soul as to govern the body in obedience 
to God? And what is as priestly as to dedicate a pure conscience to the Lord and to offer the 
spotless offerings of devotion on the altar of the heart?^14 

II. The Church—Body of Christ 


The Church is communion with Jesus 

Iftl From the beginning, Jesus associated his disciples with his own life, revealed the mystery of 
the Kingdom to them, and gave them a share in his mission, joy, and sufferings.^ Jesus spoke of a 
still more intimate communion between him and those who would follow him: “Abide in me, and I 
in you.... I am the vine, you are the branches.”^ And he proclaimed a mysterious and real 
communion between his own body and ours: “He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in 
me, and I in him.”^ ( 755 1 


788 When his visible presence was taken from them, Jesus did not leave his disciples orphans. He 







promised to remain with them until the end of time; he sent them his Spirit.^ As a result 
communion with Jesus has become, in a way, more intense: “By communicating his Spirit, Christ 
mystically constitutes as his body those brothers of his who are called together from every 
nation.”^ (690) 


789 The comparison of the Church with the body casts light on the intimate bond between Christ 
and his Church. Not only is she gathered around him; she is united in him, in his body. Three 
aspects of the Church as the Body of Christ are to be more specifically noted: the unity of all her 
members with each other as a result of their union with Christ; Christ as head of the Body; and the 
Church as bride of Christ. (521) 

“One Body” 

790 Believers who respond to God’s word and become members of Christ’s Body, become 
intimately united with him: “In that body the life of Christ is communicated to those who believe, 
and who, through the sacraments, are united in a hidden and real way to Christ in his Passion and 
glorification.”^ This is especially true of Baptism, which unites us to Christ’s death and 
Resurrection, and the Eucharist, by which “really sharing in the body of the Lord,... we are taken up 
into communion with him and with one another.”^ (947, 1227 . 1329 1 

791 The body’s unity does not do away with the diversity of its members: “In the building up of 
Christ’s Body there is engaged a diversity of members and functions. There is only one Spirit who, 
according to his own richness and the needs of the ministries, gives his different gifts for the 
welfare of the Church.”^ The unity of the Mystical Body produces and stimulates charity among 
the faithful: “From this it follows that if one member suffers anything, all the members suffer with 
him, and if one member is honored, all the members together rejoice. ”^23 Finally, the unity of the 
Mystical Body triumphs over all human divisions: “For as many of you as were baptized into Christ 
have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither 
male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 1 814 . 1937 1 

“Christ is the Head of this Body” 

792 Christ “is the head of the body, the Church.”^ He is the principle of creation and redemption. 
Raised to the Father’s glory, “in everything he [is] preeminent,”^ especially in the Church, 
through whom he extends his reign over all things. (669, 1119 ] 


793 Christ unites us with his Passover: all his members must strive to resemble him, “until Christ 











be formed” in them.^^Z “For this reason we... are taken up into the mysteries of his life,... 
associated with his sufferings as the body with its head, suffering with him, that with him we may 
be glorified.”^ ( 661 . 519 ) 

794 Christ provides for our growth: to make us grow toward him, our head,he provides in his 
Body, the Church, the gifts and assistance by which we help one another along the way of 
salvation. (872) 

795 Christ and his Church thus together make up the “whole Christ” ( Christus totus). The Church 
is one with Christ. The saints are acutely aware of this unity: ( 695 . 1474 ) 

Let us rejoice then and give thanks that we have become not only Christians, but Christ 
himself. Do you understand and grasp, brethren, God’s grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice: 
we have become Christ. For if he is the head, we are the members; he and we together are the 
whole man.... The fullness of Christ then is the head and the members. But what does “head 
and members” mean? Christ and the Church.^ 

Our redeemer has shown himself to be one person with the holy Church whom he has taken to 

himself.231 


Head and members form as it were one and the same mystical person.^ 

A reply of St. Joan of Arc to her judges sums up the faith of the holy doctors and the good 
sense of the believer: “About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they’re just one 
thing, and we shouldn’t complicate the matter.”^ 

The Church is the Bride of Christ 

796 The unity of Christ and the Church, head and members of one Body, also implies the 
distinction of the two within a personal relationship. This aspect is often expressed by the image of 
bridegroom and bride. The theme of Christ as Bridegroom of the Church was prepared for by the 
prophets and announced by John the Baptist. 224 The Lord referred to himself as the 
“bridegroom.”^ The Apostle speaks of the whole Church and of each of the faithful, members of 
his Body, as a bride “betrothed” to Christ the Lord so as to become but one spirit with him.226 The 
Church is the spotless bride of the spotless Lamb.22Z “Christ loved the Church and gave himself up 
for her, that he might sanctify her.”228 He has joined her with himself in an everlasting covenant 
and never stops caring for her as for his own body:222 (757, 219 . 772, 1602 . 1616) 












This is the whole Christ, head and body, one formed from many... whether the head or 
members speak, it is Christ who speaks. He speaks in his role as the head (ex persona capitis ) 
and in his role as body (ex persona corporis ). What does this mean? “The two will become 
one flesh. This is a great mystery, and I am applying it to Christ and the Church.”24Q And the 
Lord himself says in the Gospel: “So they are no longer two, but one flesh. ”241 They are, in 
fact, two different persons, yet they are one in the conjugal union,... as head, he calls himself 
the bridegroom, as body, he calls himself “bride. ”242 

III. The Church Is the Temple of the Holy Spirit 


797 “What the soul is to the human body, the Holy Spirit is to the Body of Christ, which is the 
Church. ”243 “Xo this Spirit of Christ, as an invisible principle, is to be ascribed the fact that all the 
parts of the body are joined one with the other and with their exalted head; for the whole Spirit of 
Christ is in the head, the whole Spirit is in the body, and the whole Spirit is in each of the 
members. ”244 The Holy Spirit makes the Church “the temple of the living God”;245 (813, 586) 

Indeed, it is to the Church herself that the “Gift of God” has been entrusted.... It is in her that 
communion with Christ has been deposited, that is to say: the Holy Spirit, the pledge of 
incorruptibility, the strengthening of our faith and the ladder of our ascent to God.... For where 
the Church is, there also is God’s Spirit; where God’s Spirit is, there is the Church and every 

grace. 246 

798 The Holy Spirit is “the principle of every vital and truly saving action in each part of the 
Body.”24Z He works in many ways to build up the whole Body in charity ;248 by God’s Word 
“which is able to build you up”;249 by Baptism, through which he forms Christ’s Body; 2^0 by the 
sacraments, which give growth and healing to Christ’s members; by “the grace of the apostles, 
which holds first place among his gifts”;25i by the virtues, which make us act according to what is 
good; finally, by the many special graces (called “charisms”), by which he makes the faithful “fit 
and ready to undertake various tasks and offices for the renewal and building up of the Church. ”242 
1 737 . 1091-1109 . 791) 

Charisms 

799 Whether extraordinary or simple and humble, charisms are graces of the Holy Spirit which 
directly or indirectly benefit the Church, ordered as they are to her building up, to the good of men, 
and to the needs of the world. (951, 2003 1 









800 Charisms are to be accepted with gratitude by the person who receives them and by all 
members of the Church as well. They are a wonderfully rich grace for the apostolic vitality and for 
the holiness of the entire Body of Christ, provided they really are genuine gifts of the Holy Spirit 
and are used in full conformity with authentic promptings of this same Spirit, that is, in keeping 
with charity, the true measure of all charisms. 253 

801 It is in this sense that discernment of charisms is always necessary. No charism is exempt from 
being referred and submitted to the Church’s shepherds. “Their office [is] not indeed to extinguish 
the Spirit, but to test all things and hold fast to what is good, ”254 S o that all the diverse and 
complementary charisms work together “for the common good.”255 (894, 1905 1 


IN BRIEF 


802 Christ Jesus “gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a 
people of his own” (Titus 2:14). 

803 “You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people” (1 Pet 2:9). 

804 One enters into the People of God by faith and Baptism. “All men are called to belong to the 
new People of God” (LG 13), so that, in Christ, “men may form one family and one People of God” 
(AG 1). 

805 The Church is the Body of Christ. Through the Spirit and his action in the sacraments, above 
all the Eucharist, Christ, who once was dead and is now risen, establishes the community of 
believers as his own Body. 

806 In the unity of this Body, there is a diversity of members and functions. All members are linked 
to one another, especially to those who are suffering, to the poor and persecuted. 

807 The Church is this Body of which Christ is the head: she lives from him, in him, and for him; 
he lives with her and in her. 

808 The Church is the Bride of Christ: he loved her and handed himself over for her. He has 
purified her by his blood and made her the fruitful mother of all God’s children. 


809 The Church is the Temple of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the soul, as it were, of the Mystical 






Body, the source of its life, of its unity in diversity, and of the riches of its gifts and charisms. 


810 “Hence the universal Church is seen to be ‘a people brought into unity from the unity of the 
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit’” (LG 4 citing St. Cyprian, De Dom. orat. 23: PL 4, 553).

Paragraph 3. The Church Is One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic 


811 “This is the sole Church of Christ, which in the Creed we profess to be one, holy, catholic and 
apostolic. ”256 These four characteristics, inseparably linked with each other, 25Z indicate essential 
features of the Church and her mission. The Church does not possess them of herself; it is Christ 
who, through the Holy Spirit, makes his Church one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, and it is he who 
calls her to realize each of these qualities. (750, 832, 865) 

812 Only faith can recognize that the Church possesses these properties from her divine source. But 
their historical manifestations are signs that also speak clearly to human reason. As the First 
Vatican Council noted, the “Church herself, with her marvellous propagation, eminent holiness, 
and inexhaustible fruitfulness in everything good, her catholic unity and invincible stability, is a 
great and perpetual motive of credibility and an irrefutable witness of her divine mission. ”256 ( 156 . 
770) 

I. The Church Is One 


“The sacred mystery of the Church’s unity” (UR 2) 

813 The Church is one because of her source: “the highest exemplar and source of this mystery is 
the unity, in the Trinity of Persons, of one God, the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit.”255 The 
Church is one because of her founder: for “the Word made flesh, the prince of peace, reconciled all 
men to God by the cross,... restoring the unity of all in one people and one body. ”266 The Church is 
one because of her “soul”: “It is the Holy Spirit, dwelling in those who believe and pervading and 
ruling over the entire Church, who brings about that wonderful communion of the faithful and joins 
them together so intimately in Christ that he is the principle of the Church’s unity. ”261 Unity is of 
the essence of the Church: ( 172 . 766 . 797) 

What an astonishing mystery! There is one Father of the universe, one Logos of the universe, 
and also one Holy Spirit, everywhere one and the same; there is also one virgin become 
mother, and I should like to call her “Church.”262 

814 From the beginning, this one Church has been marked by a great diversity which comes from 
both the variety of God’s gifts and the diversity of those who receive them. Within the unity of the 
People of God, a multiplicity of peoples and cultures is gathered together. Among the Church’s 










members, there are different gifts, offices, conditions, and ways of life. “Holding a rightful place in 
the communion of the Church there are also particular Churches that retain their own traditions.”^ 
The great richness of such diversity is not opposed to the Church’s unity. Yet sin and the burden of 
its consequences constantly threaten the gift of unity. And so the Apostle has to exhort Christians to 
“maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. ( 791 . 873 . 1202 . 832) 

815 What are these bonds of unity? Above all, charity “binds everything together in perfect 
harmony.”^ But the unity of the pilgrim Church is also assured by visible bonds of communion: 
( 1827 . 830 . 837 . 173 1 

—profession of one faith received from the Apostles 
—common celebration of divine worship, especially of the sacraments; 

—apostolic succession through the sacrament of Holy Orders, maintaining the fraternal 
concord of God’s family.^ 

816 “The sole Church of Christ [is that] which our Savior, after his Resurrection, entrusted to 
Peter’s pastoral care, commissioning him and the other apostles to extend and rule it.... This 
Church, constituted and organized as a society in the present world, subsists in (subsistit in) the 
Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the bishops in communion 
with him.”26Z ( 830 1 

The Second Vatican Council’s Decree on Ecumenism explains: “For it is through Christ’s 
Catholic Church alone, which is the universal help toward salvation, that the fullness of the 
means of salvation can be obtained. It was to the apostolic college alone, of which Peter is the 
head, that we believe that our Lord entrusted all the blessings of the New Covenant, in order to 
establish on earth the one Body of Christ into which all those should be fully incorporated who 
belong in any way to the People of God.”2hS 

Wounds to unity 

817 In fact, “in this one and only Church of God from its very beginnings there arose certain rifts, 
which the Apostle strongly censures as damnable. But in subsequent centuries much more serious 
dissensions appeared and large communities became separated from full communion with the 
Catholic Church—for which, often enough, men of both sides were to blame. ”^69 The ruptures that 
wound the unity of Christ’s Body—here we must distinguish heresy, apostasy, and schism^ZQ— do 
not occur without human sin: (2089) 












Where there are sins, there are also divisions, schisms, heresies, and disputes. Where there is 
virtue, however, there also are harmony and unity, from which arise the one heart and one soul 

of all believers .221 

818 “However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those who at present are born into 
these communities [that resulted from such separation] and in them are brought up in the faith of 
Christ, and the Catholic Church accepts them with respect and affection as brothers.... All who have 
been justified by faith in Baptism are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be 
called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord by the children of the 
Catholic Church. ”222 [ 1271 1 

819 “Furthermore, many elements of sanctification and of truth”223 are found outside the visible 
confines of the Catholic Church: “the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope, and 
charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as visible elements. ”224 Christ’s 
Spirit uses these Churches and ecclesial communities as means of salvation, whose power derives 
from the fullness of grace and truth that Christ has entrusted to the Catholic Church. All these 
blessings come from Christ and lead to him,225 anc i are j n themselves calls to “Catholic unity.”222 

Toward unity 

820 “Christ bestowed unity on his Church from the beginning. This unity, we believe, subsists in 
the Catholic Church as something she can never lose, and we hope that it will continue to increase 
until the end of time.”222 Christ always gives his Church the gift of unity, but the Church must 
always pray and work to maintain, reinforce, and perfect the unity that Christ wills for her. This is 
why Jesus himself prayed at the hour of his Passion, and does not cease praying to his Father, for 
the unity of his disciples: “That they may all be one. As you, Father, are in me and I am in you, 
may they also be one in us,... so that the world may know that you have sent me.”222 The desire to 
recover the unity of all Christians is a gift of Christ and a call of the Holy Spirit.229 ( 2748 1 

821 Certain things are required in order to respond adequately to this call: [ 827 . 2791 1 

—a permanent renewal of the Church in greater fidelity to her vocation; such renewal is the 
driving-force of the movement toward unity;22Q 
—conversion of heart as the faithful “try to live holier lives according to the Gospel”;221 
—prayer in common, because “change of heart and holiness of life, along with public and 
private prayer for the unity of Christians, should be regarded as the soul of the whole 
ecumenical movement, and merits the name ‘spiritual ecumenism; ’”222 






—fraternal knowledge of each other 

—ecumenical formation of the faithful and especially of priests; 

—dialogue among theologians and meetings among Christians of the different churches and 
communities;^ 

—collaboration among Christians in various areas of service to mankind.^ 

822 Concern for achieving unity “involves the whole Church, faithful and clergy alike. But we 
must realize “that this holy objective—the reconciliation of all Christians in the unity of the one 
and only Church of Christ—transcends human powers and gifts.” That is why we place all our hope 
“in the prayer of Christ for the Church, in the love of the Father for us, and in the power of the Holy 

Spirit.”^ 

II. The Church Is Holy 


823 “The Church... is held, as a matter of faith, to be unfailingly holy. This is because Christ, the 
Son of God, who with the Father and the Spirit is hailed as ‘alone holy,’ loved the Church as his 
Bride, giving himself up for her so as to sanctify her; he joined her to himself as his body and 
endowed her with the gift of the Holy Spirit for the glory of God.”^ The Church, then, is “the 
holy People of God,”^2Q and her members are called “saints. ”^91 (459, 796, 946) 

824 United with Christ, the Church is sanctified by him; through him and with him she becomes 
sanctifying. “All the activities of the Church are directed, as toward their end, to the sanctification 
of men in Christ and the glorification of God.”^ it is in the Church that “the fullness of the means 
of salvation”^ has been deposited. It is in her that “by the grace of God we acquire holiness. 
(816) 

825 “The Church on earth is endowed already with a sanctity that is real though imperfect.”^ In 
her members perfect holiness is something yet to be acquired: “Strengthened by so many and such 
great means of salvation, all the faithful, whatever their condition or state—though each in his own 
way—are called by the Lord to that perfection of sanctity by which the Father himself is 
perfect.”— (670, 2013 1 

826 Charity is the soul of the holiness to which all are called: it “governs, shapes, and perfects all 
the means of sanctification.”^ ( 1827 . 2658 . 864 1 


If the Church was a body composed of different members, it couldn’t lack the noblest of all; it 













must have a Heart, and a Heart BURNING WITH LOVE. And I realized that this love alone 
was the true motive force which enabled the other members of the Church to act; if it ceased to 
function, the Apostles would forget to preach the gospel, the Martyrs would refuse to shed 
their blood. LOVE, IN FACT, IS THE VOCATION WHICH INCLUDES ALL OTHERS; 
IT’S A UNIVERSE OF ITS OWN, COMPRISING ALL TIME AND SPACE—IT’S 

ETERNAL!^ 

827 “Christ, 'holy, innocent, and undefiled,’ knew nothing of sin, but came only to expiate the sins 
of the people. The Church, however, clasping sinners to her bosom, at once holy and always in 
need of purification, follows constantly the path of penance and renewal. ”222 All members of the 
Church, including her ministers, must acknowledge that they are sinners. 222 In everyone, the weeds 
of sin will still be mixed with the good wheat of the Gospel until the end of time.221 Hence the 
Church gathers sinners already caught up in Christ’s salvation but still on the way to holiness: 
1 1425-1429 . 821) 

The Church is therefore holy, though having sinners in her midst, because she herself has no 
other life but the life of grace. If they live her life, her members are sanctified; if they move 
away from her life, they fall into sins and disorders that prevent the radiation of her sanctity. 
This is why she suffers and does penance for those offenses, of which she has the power to 
free her children through the blood of Christ and the gift of the Holy Spirit.222 

828 By canonizing some of the faithful, i.e., by solemnly proclaiming that they practiced heroic 
virtue and lived in fidelity to God’s grace, the Church recognizes the power of the Spirit of holiness 
within her and sustains the hope of believers by proposing the saints to them as models and 
intercessors .223 “The sa i n t s have always been the source and origin of renewal in the most difficult 
moments in the Church’s history.”224 Indeed, “holiness is the hidden source and infallible measure 
of her apostolic activity and missionary zeal. ”223 (1173 . 2045 1 

829 “But while in the most Blessed Virgin the Church has already reached that perfection whereby 
she exists without spot or wrinkle, the faithful still strive to conquer sin and increase in holiness. 
And so they turn their eyes to Mary”;222 i n her, the Church is already the “all-holy.” ( 1172 . 972 ) 

III. The Church Is Catholic 


What does “catholic” mean? 








830 The word “catholic” means “universal,” in the sense of “according to the totality” or “in 
keeping with the whole.” The Church is catholic in a double sense: (795, 815-816 1 

First, the Church is catholic because Christ is present in her. “Where there is Christ Jesus, 
there is the Catholic Church.”^ In her subsists the fullness of Christ’s body united with its head; 
this implies that she receives from him “the fullness of the means of salvation”^ which he has 
willed: correct and complete confession of faith, full sacramental life, and ordained ministry in 
apostolic succession. The Church was, in this fundamental sense, catholic on the day of 
Pentecost^ and will always be so until the day of the Parousia. 

831 Secondly, the Church is catholic because she has been sent out by Christ on a mission to the 
whole of the human race:^ (849, 360, 518 1 

All men are called to belong to the new People of God. This People, therefore, while 
remaining one and only one, is to be spread throughout the whole world and to all ages in 
order that the design of God’s will may be fulfilled: he made human nature one in the 
beginning and has decreed that all his children who were scattered should be finally gathered 
together as one.... The character of universality which adorns the People of God is a gift from 
the Lord himself whereby the Catholic Church ceaselessly and efficaciously seeks for the 
return of all humanity and all its goods, under Christ the Head in the unity of his Spirit.^ 

Each particular Church is “catholic” 

832 “The Church of Christ is really present in all legitimately organized local groups of the faithful, 
which, in so far as they are united to their pastors, are also quite appropriately called Churches in 
the New Testament.... In them the faithful are gathered together through the preaching of the 
Gospel of Christ, and the mystery of the Lord’s Supper is celebrated.... In these communities, 
though they may often be small and poor, or existing in the diaspora, Christ is present, through 
whose power and influence the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church is constituted.”^ ( 814 . 
811 1 

833 The phrase “particular church,” which is first of all the diocese (or eparchy), refers to a 
community of the Christian faithful in communion of faith and sacraments with their bishop 
ordained in apostolic succession.^ These particular Churches “are constituted after the model of 
the universal Church; it is in these and formed out of them that the one and unique Catholic Church 

exists. ”^14 (886) 


834 Particular Churches are fully catholic through their communion with one of them, the Church 










of Rome “which presides in charity.”212 “For with this church, by reason of its pre-eminence, the 
whole Church, that is the faithful everywhere, must necessarily be in accord.”21b Indeed, “from the 
incarnate Word’s descent to us, all Christian churches everywhere have held and hold the great 
Church that is here [at Rome] to be their only basis and foundation since, according to the Savior’s 
promise, the gates of hell have never prevailed against her.”31Z (882, 1369 ] 

835 “Let us be very careful not to conceive of the universal Church as the simple sum, or... the 
more or less anomalous federation of essentially different particular churches. In the mind of the 
Lord the Church is universal by vocation and mission, but when she puts down her roots in a 
variety of cultural, social, and human terrains, she takes on different external expressions and 
appearances in each part of the world.”— The rich variety of ecclesiastical disciplines, liturgical 
rites, and theological and spiritual heritages proper to the local churches “unified in a common 
effort, shows all the more resplendently the catholicity of the undivided Church.”2I2 ( 1202 ] 

Who belongs to the Catholic Church? 

836 “All men are called to this catholic unity of the People of God.... And to it, in different ways, 
belong or are ordered: the Catholic faithful, others who believe in Christ, and finally all mankind, 
called by God’s grace to salvation.”22Q ( 831 ] 

837 “Fully incorporated into the society of the Church are those who, possessing the Spirit of 
Christ, accept all the means of salvation given to the Church together with her entire organization, 
and who—by the bonds constituted by the profession of faith, the sacraments, ecclesiastical 
government, and communion—are joined in the visible structure of the Church of Christ, who rules 
her through the Supreme Pontiff and the bishops. Even though incorporated into the Church, one 
who does not however persevere in charity is not saved. He remains indeed in the bosom of the 
Church, but ‘in body’ not ‘in heart. ’”221 (771, 815, 882 ] 

838 “The Church knows that she is joined in many ways to the baptized who are honored by the 
name of Christian, but do not profess the Catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or 
communion under the successor of Peter.”222 Those “who believe in Christ and have been properly 
baptized are put in a certain, although imperfect, communion with the Catholic Church. ”223 With 
the Orthodox Churches, this communion is so profound “that it lacks little to attain the fullness that 
would permit a common celebration of the Lord’s Eucharist.”22d ( 818 . 1271 . 1399 ] 


The Church and non-Christians 












839 “Those who have not yet received the Gospel are related to the People of God in various 
ways.”325 (856, 63, 147) 

The relationship of the Church with the Jewish People. When she delves into her own mystery, the 
Church, the People of God in the New Covenant, discovers her link with the Jewish People, 32b “the 
first to hear the Word of God.”32Z The Jewish faith, unlike other non-Christian religions, is already 
a response to God’s revelation in the Old Covenant. To the Jews “belong the sonship, the glory, the 
covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and 
of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ”;32b “for the gifts and the call of God are 
irrevocable. ”322 


840 And when one considers the future, God’s People of the Old Covenant and the new People of 
God tend towards similar goals: expectation of the coming (or the return) of the Messiah. But one 
awaits the return of the Messiah who died and rose from the dead and is recognized as Lord and 
Son of God; the other awaits the coming of a Messiah, whose features remain hidden till the end of 
time; and the latter waiting is accompanied by the drama of not knowing or of misunderstanding 
Christ Jesus. ( 674 . 597 ) 

841 The Church’s relationship with the Muslims. “The plan of salvation also includes those who 
acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom are the Muslims; these profess to hold 
the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind’s judge on 
the last day.”33Q 

842 The Church’s bond with non-Christian religions is in the first place the common origin and end 
of the human race: (360) 

All nations form but one community. This is so because all stem from the one stock which 
God created to people the entire earth, and also because all share a common destiny, namely 
God. His providence, evident goodness, and saving designs extend to all against the day when 
the elect are gathered together in the holy city.... 321 

843 The Catholic Church recognizes in other religions that search, among shadows and images, for 
the God who is unknown yet near since he gives life and breath and all things and wants all men to 
be saved. Thus, the Church considers all goodness and truth found in these religions as “a 
preparation for the Gospel and given by him who enlightens all men that they may at length have 
life. ”332 (28, 856) 


844 In their religious behavior, however, men also display the limits and errors that disfigure the 








image of God in them: (29) 


Very often, deceived by the Evil One, men have become vain in their reasonings, and have 
exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and served the creature rather than the Creator. Or else, 
living and dying in this world without God, they are exposed to ultimate despair.223 

845 To reunite all his children, scattered and led astray by sin, the Father willed to call the whole of 
humanity together into his Son’s Church. The Church is the place where humanity must rediscover 
its unity and salvation. The Church is “the world reconciled.” She is that bark which “in the full sail 
of the Lord’s cross, by the breath of the Holy Spirit, navigates safely in this world.” According to 
another image dear to the Church Fathers, she is prefigured by Noah’s ark, which alone saves from 
the flood.2M ( 30 , 953, 1219 1 

“Outside the Church there is no salvation” 

846 How are we to understand this affirmation, often repeated by the Church Fathers?^ Re¬ 
formulated positively, it means that all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church 
which is his Body: ( 161 . 1257 1 

Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on 
earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is 
present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of 
faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which 
men enter through Baptism as through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing 
that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either 
to enter it or to remain in it.22b 

847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ 
and his Church: 

Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but 
who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do 
his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience—those too may achieve 
eternal salvation. 327 

848 “Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no fault of their own, 
are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith without which it is impossible to please him, the Church 







still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men.”228 (1260) 


Mission—a requirement of the Church’s catholicity 

849 The missionary mandate. “Having been divinely sent to the nations that she might be ‘the 
universal sacrament of salvation,’ the Church, in obedience to the command of her founder and 
because it is demanded by her own essential universality, strives to preach the Gospel to all 
men”: 239 “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father 
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and 
Lo, I am with you always, until the close of the age.”21Q (738, 767 ) 

850 The origin and purpose of mission. The Lord’s missionary mandate is ultimately grounded in 
the eternal love of the Most Holy Trinity: “The Church on earth is by her nature missionary since, 
according to the plan of the Father, she has as her origin the mission of the Son and the Holy 
Spirit. ”241 The ultimate purpose of mission is none other than to make men share in the 
communion between the Father and the Son in their Spirit of love. 242 (257, 730) 

851 Missionary motivation. It is from God’s love for all men that the Church in every age receives 
both the obligation and the vigor of her missionary dynamism, “for the love of Christ urges us 
on .”243 indeed God “desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth”;244 
that is, God wills the salvation of everyone through the knowledge of the truth. Salvation is found 
in the truth. Those who obey the prompting of the Spirit of truth are already on the way of 
salvation. But the Church, to whom this truth has been entrusted, must go out to meet their desire, 
so as to bring them the truth. Because she believes in God’s universal plan of salvation, the Church 
must be missionary. 1 221 . 429 . 74, 217, 2104 . 890 ) 

852 Missionary paths. The Holy Spirit is the protagonist, “the principal agent of the whole of the 
Church’s mission.”215 it is he who leads the Church on her missionary paths. “This mission 
continues and, in the course of history, unfolds the mission of Christ, who was sent to evangelize 
the poor; so the Church, urged on by the Spirit of Christ, must walk the road Christ himself walked, 
a way of poverty and obedience, of service and self-sacrifice even to death, a death from which he 
emerged victorious by his resurrection.”24§ So it is that “the blood of martyrs is the seed of 
Christians. ”2TZ 1 2044 . 2473 ) 

853 On her pilgrimage, the Church has also experienced the “discrepancy existing between the 
message she proclaims and the human weakness of those to whom the Gospel has been 
entrusted.”242 Only by taking the “way of penance and renewal,” the “narrow way of the cross,” 














can the People of God extend Christ’s reign.249 For “just as Christ carried out the work of 
redemption in poverty and oppression, so the Church is called to follow the same path if she is to 
communicate the fruits of salvation to men.”^ ( 1428 . 2443 1 

854 By her very mission, “the Church... travels the same journey as all humanity and shares the 
same earthly lot with the world: she is to be a leaven and, as it were, the soul of human society in 
its renewal by Christ and transformation into the family of God.”^i Missionary endeavor requires 
patience. It begins with the proclamation of the Gospel to peoples and groups who do not yet 
believe in Christ, ^2 continues with the establishment of Christian communities that are “a sign of 
God’s presence in the world, and leads to the foundation of local churches.^ It must involve a 
process of inculturation if the Gospel is to take flesh in each people’s culture.^ There will be 
times of defeat. “With regard to individuals, groups, and peoples it is only by degrees that [the 
Church] touches and penetrates them, and so receives them into a fullness which is Catholic.”^ 
1 2105 . 1204 1 

855 The Church’s mission stimulates efforts towards Christian unity .-^Z Indeed, “divisions among 
Christians prevent the Church from realizing in practice the fullness of catholicity proper to her in 
those of her sons who, though joined to her by Baptism, are yet separated from full communion 
with her. Furthermore, the Church herself finds it more difficult to express in actual life her full 
catholicity in all its aspects.”^ [ 821 1 

856 The missionary task implies a respectful dialogue with those who do not yet accept the 
Gospel.^ Believers can profit from this dialogue by learning to appreciate better “those elements 
of truth and grace which are found among peoples, and which are, as it were, a secret presence of 
God.”2hQ They proclaim the Good News to those who do not know it, in order to consolidate, 
complete, and raise up the truth and the goodness that God has distributed among men and nations, 
and to purify them from error and evil “for the glory of God, the confusion of the demon, and the 
happiness of man.”2hl [ 839 . 843 1 

IV. The Church Is Apostolic 


857 The Church is apostolic because she is founded on the apostles, in three ways: (75, 171, 880 . 
1 575) 


she was and remains built on “the foundation of the Apostles,the witnesses chosen and 
sent on mission by Christ himself;^ 












—with the help of the Spirit dwelling in her, the Church keeps and hands on the teaching, 
the “good deposit,” the salutary words she has heard from the apostles;^ 

—she continues to be taught, sanctified, and guided by the apostles until Christ’s return, 
through their successors in pastoral office: the college of bishops, “assisted by priests, in 
union with the successor of Peter, the Church’s supreme pastor”:^ 

You are the eternal Shepherd 
who never leaves his flock untended. 

Through the apostles 

you watch over us and protect us always. 

You made them shepherds of the flock 
to share in the work of your Son.... 2hZ 

The Apostles’ mission 

858 Jesus is the Father’s Emissary. From the beginning of his ministry, he “called to him those 
whom he desired;.... And he appointed twelve, whom also he named apostles, to be with him, and 
to be sent out to preach.”^ From then on, they would also be his “emissaries” (Greek apostoloi ). 
In them, Christ continues his own mission: “As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.”2h9 The 
apostles’ ministry is the continuation of his mission; Jesus said to the Twelve: “he who receives 
you receives me.”^ (551, 425, 1086 1 

859 Jesus unites them to the mission he received from the Father. As “the Son can do nothing of his 
own accord,” but receives everything from the Father who sent him, so those whom Jesus sends can 
do nothing apart from him, ^21 from whom they received both the mandate for their mission and the 
power to carry it out. Christ’s apostles knew that they were called by God as “ministers of a new 
covenant,” “servants of God,” “ambassadors for Christ,” “servants of Christ and stewards of the 
mysteries of God.”^ ( 876 1 

860 In the office of the apostles there is one aspect that cannot be transmitted: to be the chosen 
witnesses of the Ford’s Resurrection and so the foundation stones of the Church. But their office 
also has a permanent aspect. Christ promised to remain with them always. The divine mission 
entrusted by Jesus to them “will continue to the end of time, since the Gospel they handed on is the 
lasting source of all life for the Church. Therefore,... the apostles took care to appoint 
successors.”^ (642, 765, 1087 1 


The bishops—successors of the apostles 









861 “In order that the mission entrusted to them might be continued after their death, [the apostles] 
consigned, by will and testament, as it were, to their immediate collaborators the duty of 
completing and consolidating the work they had begun, urging them to tend to the whole flock, in 
which the Holy Spirit had appointed them to shepherd the Church of God. They accordingly 
designated such men and then made the ruling that likewise on their death other proven men should 
take over their ministry. ”TZ4 ( 77 ^ 1087) 

862 “Just as the office which the Lord confided to Peter alone, as first of the apostles, destined to 
be transmitted to his successors, is a permanent one, so also endures the office, which the apostles 
received, of shepherding the Church, a charge destined to be exercised without interruption by the 
sacred order of bishops. Hence the Church teaches that “the bishops have by divine institution 
taken the place of the apostles as pastors of the Church, in such wise that whoever listens to them is 
listening to Christ and whoever despises them despises Christ and him who sent Christ.”^ ( 880 . 
1556 1 

The apostolate 

863 The whole Church is apostolic, in that she remains, through the successors of St. Peter and the 
other apostles, in communion of faith and life with her origin: and in that she is “sent out” into the 
whole world. All members of the Church share in this mission, though in various ways. “The 
Christian vocation is, of its nature, a vocation to the apostolate as well.” Indeed, we call an 
apostolate “every activity of the Mystical Body” that aims “to spread the Kingdom of Christ over 
all the earth. ”TZZ (900, 2472 1 

864 “Christ, sent by the Father, is the source of the Church’s whole apostolate”; thus the 
fruitfulness of apostolate for ordained ministers as well as for lay people clearly depends on their 
vital union with Christ. TZB i n keeping with their vocations, the demands of the times and the 
various gifts of the Holy Spirit, the apostolate assumes the most varied forms. But charity, drawn 
from the Eucharist above all, is always “as it were, the soul of the whole apostolate. ”TZ9 (828, 824 . 
1324 1 

865 The Church is ultimately one, holy, catholic, and apostolic in her deepest and ultimate identity, 
because it is in her that “the Kingdom of heaven,” the “Reign of God,”^ already exists and will be 
fulfilled at the end of time. The kingdom has come in the person of Christ and grows mysteriously 
in the hearts of those incorporated into him, until its full eschatological manifestation. Then all 
those he has redeemed and made “holy and blameless before him in love,”^l will be gathered 










together as the one People of God, the “Bride of the Lamb, ”552 “the holy city Jerusalem coming 
down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.”553 For “the wall of the city had twelve 
foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.”5M ( 811 . 541) 


IN BRIEF 


866 The Church is one: she acknowledges one Lord, confesses one faith, is born of one Baptism, 
forms only one Body, is given life by the one Spirit, for the sake of one hope (cf. Eph 4:3-5), at 
whose fulfillment all divisions will be overcome. 

867 The Church is holy: the Most Holy God is her author; Christ, her bridegroom, gave himself up 
to make her holy; the Spirit of holiness gives her life. Since she still includes sinners, she is “the 
sinless one made up of sinners.” Her holiness shines in the saints; in Mary she is already all-holy. 

868 The Church is catholic: she proclaims the fullness of the faith. She bears in herself and 
administers the totality of the means of salvation. She is sent out to all peoples. She speaks to all 
men. She encompasses all times. She is “missionary of her very nature” (AG 2). 

869 The Church is apostolic. She is built on a lasting foundation: “the twelve apostles of the Lamb” 
(Rev 21:14). She is indestructible (cf. Mt 16:18). She is upheld infallibly in the truth: Christ 
governs her through Peter and the other apostles, who are present in their successors, the Pope and 
the college of bishops. 

870 “The sole Church of Christ which in the Creed we profess to be one, holy, catholic, and 
apostolic,... subsists in the Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the 
bishops in communion with him. Nevertheless, many elements of sanctification and of truth are 
found outside its visible confines”(LG 8).

Paragraph 4. Christ’s Faithful—Hierarchy, Laity, Consecrated Life 


871 “The Christian faithful are those who, inasmuch as they have been incorporated in Christ 
through Baptism, have been constituted as the people of God; for this reason, since they have 
become sharers in Christ’s priestly, prophetic, and royal office in their own manner, they are called 
to exercise the mission which God has entrusted to the Church to fulfill in the world, in accord with 
the condition proper to each one. ”225 ( 1268-1269 . 782-786 1 

872 “In virtue of their rebirth in Christ there exists among all the Christian faithful a true equality 
with regard to dignity and the activity whereby all cooperate in the building up of the Body of 
Christ in accord with each one’s own condition and function.”222 (1934, 794 1 

873 The very differences which the Lord has willed to put between the members of his body serve 
its unity and mission. For “in the Church there is diversity of ministry but unity of mission. To the 
apostles and their successors Christ has entrusted the office of teaching, sanctifying, and governing 
in his name and by his power. But the laity are made to share in the priestly, prophetical, and kingly 
office of Christ; they have therefore, in the Church and in the world, their own assignment in the 
mission of the whole People of God.”22Z Finally, “from both groups [hierarchy and laity] there 
exist Christian faithful who are consecrated to God in their own special manner and serve the 
salvific mission of the Church through the profession of the evangelical counsels. ”222 (8M, 1937 1 

I. The Hierarchical Constitution of the Church 


Why the ecclesial ministry? 

874 Christ is himself the source of ministry in the Church. He instituted the Church. He gave her 
authority and mission, orientation and goal: ( 1544 1 

In order to shepherd the People of God and to increase its numbers without cease, Christ the 
Lord set up in his Church a variety of offices which aim at the good of the whole body. The 
holders of office, who are invested with a sacred power, are, in fact, dedicated to promoting 
the interests of their brethren, so that all who belong to the People of God... may attain to 

salvation.222 

875 “How are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear 
without a preacher? And how can men preach unless they are sent?”222 Nc&gt; one—no individual and 










no community—can proclaim the Gospel to himself: “Faith comes from what is heard.”^i Nc&gt; one 
can give himself the mandate and the mission to proclaim the Gospel. The one sent by the Lord 
does not speak and act on his own authority, but by virtue of Christ’s authority; not as a member of 
the community, but speaking to it in the name of Christ. No one can bestow grace on himself; it 
must be given and offered. This fact presupposes ministers of grace, authorized and empowered by 
Christ. From him, bishops and priests receive the mission and faculty (“the sacred power”) to act in 
persona Christi Capitis; deacons receive the strength to serve the people of God in the diaconia of 
liturgy, word, and charity, in communion with the bishop and his presbyterate. The ministry in 
which Christ’s emissaries do and give by God’s grace what they cannot do and give by their own 
powers, is called a “sacrament” by the Church’s tradition. Indeed, the ministry of the Church is 
conferred by a special sacrament. (166, 1548 . 1536 ) 

876 Intrinsically linked to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry is its character as service. 
Entirely dependent on Christ who gives mission and authority, ministers are truly “slaves of 
Christ, ”^22 i n the image of him who freely took “the form of a slave” for us.293 Because the word 
and grace of which they are ministers are not their own, but are given to them by Christ for the sake 
of others, they must freely become the slaves of all.^4 ( 1551 . 427 1 

877 Likewise, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry that it have a collegial 
character. In fact, from the beginning of his ministry, the Lord Jesus instituted the Twelve as “the 
seeds of the new Israel and the beginning of the sacred hierarchy.”^ Chosen together, they were 
also sent out together, and their fraternal unity would be at the service of the fraternal communion 
of all the faithful: they would reflect and witness to the communion of the divine persons.226 For 
this reason every bishop exercises his ministry from within the episcopal college, in communion 
with the bishop of Rome, the successor of St. Peter and head of the college. So also priests exercise 
their ministry from within the presbyterium of the diocese, under the direction of their bishop. 
1 1559 1 

878 Finally, it belongs to the sacramental nature of ecclesial ministry that it have a personal 
character. Although Christ’s ministers act in communion with one another, they also always act in 
a personal way. Each one is called personally: “You, follow me”^22 i n order to be a personal 
witness within the common mission, to bear personal responsibility before him who gives the 
mission, acting “in his person” and for other persons: “I baptize you in the name of the Father and 
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...”; “I absolve you....” (1484) 


879 Sacramental ministry in the Church, then, is a service exercised in the name of Christ. It has a 









personal character and a collegial form. This is evidenced by the bonds between the episcopal 
college and its head, the successor of St. Peter, and in the relationship between the bishop’s pastoral 
responsibility for his particular church and the common solicitude of the episcopal college for the 
universal Church. 

The episcopal college and its head, the Pope 

880 When Christ instituted the Twelve, “he constituted [them] in the form of a college or 
permanent assembly, at the head of which he placed Peter, chosen from among them.”22B j us t a s 
“by the Lord’s institution, St. Peter and the rest of the apostles constitute a single apostolic college, 
so in like fashion the Roman Pontiff, Peter’s successor, and the bishops, the successors of the 
apostles, are related with and united to one another.”^ (552, 862 ] 

881 The Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the “rock” of his Church. He gave him 
the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock.426 “The office of binding 
and loosing which was given to Peter was also assigned to the college of apostles united to its 
head.”42i This pastoral office of Peter and the other apostles belongs to the Church’s very 
foundation and is continued by the bishops under the primacy of the Pope. (553, 642 ] 

882 The Pope, Bishop of Rome and Peter’s successor, “is the perpetual and visible source and 
foundation of the unity both of the bishops and of the whole company of the faithful. ”422 “For the 
Roman Pontiff, by reason of his office as Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the entire Church has 
full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise 
unhindered. ”423 (834, 1369, 837 ] 

883 “The college or body of bishops has no authority unless united with the Roman Pontiff, Peter’s 
successor, as its head.” As such, this college has “supreme and full authority over the universal 
Church; but this power cannot be exercised without the agreement of the Roman Pontiff. ”424 

884 “The college of bishops exercises power over the universal Church in a solemn manner in an 
ecumenical council. ”425 But “there never is an ecumenical council which is not confirmed or at 
least recognized as such by Peter’s successor. ”426 

885 “This college, in so far as it is composed of many members, is the expression of the variety and 
universality of the People of God; and of the unity of the flock of Christ, in so far as it is assembled 
under one head.”427 









886 “The individual bishops are the visible source and foundation of unity in their own particular 
Churches. ”422 As such, they “exercise their pastoral office over the portion of the People of God 
assigned to them, ”429 assisted by priests and deacons. But, as a member of the episcopal college, 
each bishop shares in the concern for all the Churches.412 The bishops exercise this care first “by 
ruling well their own Churches as portions of the universal Church,” and so contributing “to the 
welfare of the whole Mystical Body, which, from another point of view, is a corporate body of 
Churches. ”411 They extend it especially to the poor, 412 to those persecuted for the faith, as well as 
to missionaries who are working throughout the world. ( 1560 . 833 . 2448 1 

887 Neighboring particular Churches who share the same culture form ecclesiastical provinces or 
larger groupings called patriarchates or regions.413 The bishops of these groupings can meet in 
synods or provincial councils. “In a like fashion, the episcopal conferences at the present time are 
in a position to contribute in many and fruitful ways to the concrete realization of the collegiate 
S pirit.”414 

The teaching office 85-87 . 2032-2040 

888 Bishops, with priests as co-workers, have as their first task “to preach the Gospel of God to all 
men,” in keeping with the Lord’s command.412 They are “heralds of faith, who draw new disciples 
to Christ; they are authentic teachers” of the apostolic faith “endowed with the authority of 
Christ.”4!6 (2068) 

889 In order to preserve the Church in the purity of the faith handed on by the apostles, Christ who 
is the Truth willed to confer on her a share in his own infallibility. By a “supernatural sense of 
faith” the People of God, under the guidance of the Church’s living Magisterium, “unfailingly 
adheres to this faith. ”412 ( 92 ) 

890 The mission of the Magisterium is linked to the definitive nature of the covenant established by 
God with his people in Christ. It is this Magisterium’s task to preserve God’s people from 
deviations and defections and to guarantee them the objective possibility of professing the true faith 
without error. Thus, the pastoral duty of the Magisterium is aimed at seeing to it that the People of 
God abides in the truth that liberates. To fulfill this service, Christ endowed the Church’s shepherds 
with the charism of infallibility in matters of faith and morals. The exercise of this charism takes 
several forms: 1 851 . 1785 1 

891 “The Roman Pontiff, head of the college of bishops, enjoys this infallibility in virtue of his 
office, when, as supreme pastor and teacher of all the faithful—who confirms his brethren in the 










faith—he proclaims by a definitive act a doctrine pertaining to faith or morals.... The infallibility 
promised to the Church is also present in the body of bishops when, together with Peter’s 
successor, they exercise the supreme Magisterium,” above all in an Ecumenical Council.412 When 
the Church through its supreme Magisterium proposes a doctrine “for belief as being divinely 
revealed, ”412 and as the teaching of Christ, the definitions “must be adhered to with the obedience 
of faith. ”420 This infallibility extends as far as the deposit of divine Revelation itself. 421 

892 Divine assistance is also given to the successors of the apostles, teaching in communion with 
the successor of Peter, and, in a particular way, to the bishop of Rome, pastor of the whole Church, 
when, without arriving at an infallible definition and without pronouncing in a “definitive manner,” 
they propose in the exercise of the ordinary Magisterium a teaching that leads to better 
understanding of Revelation in matters of faith and morals. To this ordinary teaching the faithful 
“are to adhere to it with religious assent”422 which, though distinct from the assent of faith, is 
nonetheless an extension of it. 

The sanctifying office 

893 The bishop is “the steward of the grace of the supreme priesthood, ”423 especially in the 
Eucharist which he offers personally or whose offering he assures through the priests, his co¬ 
workers. The Eucharist is the center of the life of the particular Church. The bishop and priests 
sanctify the Church by their prayer and work, by their ministry of the word and of the sacraments. 
They sanctify her by their example, “not as domineering over those in your charge but being 
examples to the flock.”424 Thus, “together with the flock entrusted to them, they may attain to 
eternal life. ”422 (1561) 

The governing office 

894 “The bishops, as vicars and legates of Christ, govern the particular Churches assigned to them 
by their counsels, exhortations, and example, but over and above that also by the authority and 
sacred power” which indeed they ought to exercise so as to edify, in the spirit of service which is 
that of their Master.42b (801) 

895 “The power which they exercise personally in the name of Christ, is proper, ordinary, and 
immediate, although its exercise is ultimately controlled by the supreme authority of the 
Church.”42Z But the bishops should not be thought of as vicars of the Pope. His ordinary and 
immediate authority over the whole Church does not annul, but on the contrary confirms and 
defends that of the bishops. Their authority must be exercised in communion with the whole 




Church under the guidance of the Pope. (1558) 


896 The Good Shepherd ought to be the model and “form” of the bishop’s pastoral office. 
Conscious of his own weaknesses, “the bishop... can have compassion for those who are ignorant 
and erring. He should not refuse to listen to his subjects whose welfare he promotes as of his very 
own children.... The faithful... should be closely attached to the bishop as the Church is to Jesus 
Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to the Father” ;428 (1550 ) 

Let all follow the bishop, as Jesus Christ follows his Father, and the college of presbyters as 
the apostles; respect the deacons as you do God’s law. Let no one do anything concerning the 
Church in separation from the bishop.429 

II. The Lay Faithful 


897 “The term ‘laity’ is here understood to mean all the faithful except those in Holy Orders and 
those who belong to a religious state approved by the Church. That is, the faithful, who by Baptism 
are incorporated into Christ and integrated into the People of God, are made sharers in their 
particular way in the priestly, prophetic, and kingly office of Christ, and have their own part to play 
in the mission of the whole Christian people in the Church and in the world. ”422 (873) 

The vocation of lay people 

898 “By reason of their special vocation it belongs to the laity to seek the kingdom of God by 
engaging in temporal affairs and directing them according to God’s will.... It pertains to them in a 
special way so to illuminate and order all temporal things with which they are closely associated 
that these may always be effected and grow according to Christ and may be to the glory of the 
Creator and Redeemer.”421 ( 2105 1 

899 The initiative of lay Christians is necessary especially when the matter involves discovering or 
inventing the means for permeating social, political, and economic realities with the demands of 
Christian doctrine and life. This initiative is a normal element of the life of the Church: ( 2442 1 

Lay believers are in the front line of Church life; for them the Church is the animating 
principle of human society. Therefore, they in particular ought to have an ever-clearer 
consciousness not only of belonging to the Church, but of being the Church, that is to say, the 
community of the faithful on earth under the leadership of the Pope, the common Head, and of 
the bishops in communion with him. They are the Church.422 







900 Since, like all the faithful, lay Christians are entrusted by God with the apostolate by virtue of 
their Baptism and Confirmation, they have the right and duty, individually or grouped in 
associations, to work so that the divine message of salvation may be known and accepted by all 
men throughout the earth. This duty is the more pressing when it is only through them that men can 
hear the Gospel and know Christ. Their activity in ecclesial communities is so necessary that, for 
the most part, the apostolate of the pastors cannot be fully effective without it.423 (863) 

The participation of lay people in Christ’s priestly office 

901 “Hence the laity, dedicated as they are to Christ and anointed by the Holy Spirit, are 
marvellously called and prepared so that even richer fruits of the Spirit may be produced in them. 
For all their works, prayers, and apostolic undertakings, family and married life, daily work, 
relaxation of mind and body, if they are accomplished in the Spirit—indeed even the hardships of 
life if patiently born—all these become spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 
In the celebration of the Eucharist these may most fittingly be offered to the Father along with the 
body of the Lord. And so, worshipping everywhere by their holy actions, the laity consecrate the 
world itself to God, everywhere offering worship by the holiness of their lives. ”424 (784, 1268 . 
358) 

902 In a very special way, parents share in the office of sanctifying “by leading a conjugal life in 
the Christian spirit and by seeing to the Christian education of their children.”^ 

903 Lay people who possess the required qualities can be admitted permanently to the ministries of 
lector and acolyte. 42h “When the necessity of the Church warrants it and when ministers are 
lacking, lay persons, even if they are not lectors or acolytes, can also supply for certain of their 
offices, namely, to exercise the ministry of the word, to preside over liturgical prayers, to confer 
Baptism, and to distribute Holy Communion in accord with the prescriptions of law.”42Z (1143) 

Participation in Christ’s prophetic office 

904 “Christ... fulfills this prophetic office, not only by the hierarchy... but also by the laity. He 
accordingly both establishes them as witnesses and provides them with the sense of the faith 
[sensus fidei ] and the grace of the word”;422 ( 785 . 92) 

To teach in order to lead others to faith is the task of every preacher and of each believer. 429 


905 Lay people also fulfill their prophetic mission by evangelization, “that is, the proclamation of 








Christ by word and the testimony of life.” For lay people, “this evangelization... acquires a specific 
property and peculiar efficacy because it is accomplished in the ordinary circumstances of the 
world.”440 ( 2044 . 2472 1 


This witness of life, however, is not the sole element in the apostolate; the true apostle is on 
the lookout for occasions of announcing Christ by word, either to unbelievers... or to the 

faithful.^TL 


906 Lay people who are capable and trained may also collaborate in catechetical formation, in 
teaching the sacred sciences, and in use of the communications media.442 ( 2495 ) 

907 “In accord with the knowledge, competence, and preeminence which they possess, [lay people] 
have the right and even at times a duty to manifest to the sacred pastors their opinion on matters 
which pertain to the good of the Church, and they have a right to make their opinion known to the 
other Christian faithful, with due regard to the integrity of faith and morals and reverence toward 
their pastors, and with consideration for the common good and the dignity of persons. ”442 

Participation in Christ’s kingly office 

908 By his obedience unto death,: 444 Christ communicated to his disciples the gift of royal freedom, 
so that they might “by the self-abnegation of a holy life, overcome the reign of sin in 
themselves”: 442 [ 786 1 

That man is rightly called a king who makes his own body an obedient subject and, by 
governing himself with suitable rigor, refuses to let his passions breed rebellion in his soul, for 
he exercises a kind of royal power over himself. And because he knows how to rule his own 
person as king, so too does he sit as its judge. He will not let himself be imprisoned by sin, or 
thrown headlong into wickedness.44§ 

909 “Moreover, by uniting their forces let the laity so remedy the institutions and conditions of the 
world when the latter are an inducement to sin, that these may be conformed to the norms of 
justice, favoring rather than hindering the practice of virtue. By so doing they will impregnate 
culture and human works with a moral value. ”44Z (1887) 

910 “The laity can also feel called, or be in fact called, to cooperate with their pastors in the service 
of the ecclesial community, for the sake of its growth and life. This can be done through the 
exercise of different kinds of ministries according to the grace and charisms which the Lord has 







been pleased to bestow on them.”448 1 799 1 


911 In the Church, “lay members of the Christian faithful can cooperate in the exercise of this 
power [of governance] in accord with the norm of law. ”449 And so the Church provides for their 
presence at particular councils, diocesan synods, pastoral councils; the exercise of the pastoral care 
of a parish, collaboration in finance committees, and participation in ecclesiastical tribunals, etc.— 

912 The faithful should “distinguish carefully between the rights and the duties which they have as 
belonging to the Church and those which fall to them as members of the human society. They will 
strive to unite the two harmoniously, remembering that in every temporal affair they are to be 
guided by a Christian conscience, since no human activity, even of the temporal order, can be 
withdrawn from God’s dominion.”45I [ 2245 1 

913 “Thus, every person, through these gifts given to him, is at once the witness and the living 
instrument of the mission of the Church itself 'according to the measure of Christ’s bestowal . ’”492 

III. The Consecrated Life 


914 “The state of life which is constituted by the profession of the evangelical counsels, while not 
entering into the hierarchical structure of the Church, belongs undeniably to her life and 
holiness. ”493 [ 2103 1 

Evangelical counsels, consecrated life 

915 Christ proposes the evangelical counsels, in their great variety, to every disciple. The 
perfection of charity, to which all the faithful are called, entails for those who freely follow the call 
to consecrated life the obligation of practicing chastity in celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom, 
poverty and obedience. It is the profession of these counsels, within a permanent state of life 
recognized by the Church, that characterizes the life consecrated to God.454 [ 1973-1974 1 

916 The state of consecrated life is thus one way of experiencing a “more intimate” consecration, 
rooted in Baptism and dedicated totally to God.44? In the consecrated life, Christ’s faithful, moved 
by the Holy Spirit, propose to follow Christ more nearly, to give themselves to God who is loved 
above all and, pursuing the perfection of charity in the service of the Kingdom, to signify and 
proclaim in the Church the glory of the world to come.4ih ( 2687 . 933 1 


One great tree, with many branches 








917 “From the God-given seed of the counsels a wonderful and wide-spreading tree has grown up 
in the field of the Lord, branching out into various forms of the religious life lived in solitude or in 
community. Different religious families have come into existence in which spiritual resources are 
multiplied for the progress in holiness of their members and for the good of the entire Body of 

Christ ”45Z ( 2684 1 

918 From the very beginning of the Church there were men and women who set out to follow 
Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate him more closely, by practicing the evangelical counsels. 
They led lives dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit, became hermits or founded religious families. These the Church, by virtue of her 
authority, gladly accepted and approved. 4^2 

919 Bishops will always strive to discern new gifts of consecrated life granted to the Church by the 
Holy Spirit; the approval of new forms of consecrated life is reserved to the Apostolic See.4^2 

The eremitic life 

920 Without always professing the three evangelical counsels publicly, hermits “devote their life to 
the praise of God and salvation of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the 
silence of solitude and assiduous prayer and penance. ”4hQ 

921 They manifest to everyone the interior aspect of the mystery of the Church, that is, personal 
intimacy with Christ. Hidden from the eyes of men, the life of the hermit is a silent preaching of the 
Lord, to whom he has surrendered his life simply because he is everything to him. Here is a 
particular call to find in the desert, in the thick of spiritual battle, the glory of the Crucified One. 
( 2719 . 2015) 

Consecrated virgins and widows 

922 From apostolic times Christian virgins4hl and widows, 4h2 called by the Lord to cling only to 
him with greater freedom of heart, body, and spirit, have decided with the Church’s approval to live 
in the respective states of virginity or perpetual chastity “for the sake of the Kingdom of 
heaven.”4h3 0618-1620 1 

923 “Virgins who, committed to the holy plan of following Christ more closely, are consecrated to 
God by the diocesan bishop according to the approved liturgical rite, are betrothed mystically to 
Christ, the Son of God, and are dedicated to the service of the Church.”4h4 gy so lemn rite 







(Consecratio Virginum), the virgin is “constituted... a sacred person, a transcendent sign of the 
Church’s love for Christ, and an eschatological image of this heavenly Bride of Christ and of the 
life to come.”465 ( 1537 . 1672 1 

924 “As with other forms of consecrated life,” the order of virgins establishes the woman living in 
the world (or the nun) in prayer, penance, service of her brethren, and apostolic activity, according 
to the state of life and spiritual gifts given to her.4S6 Consecrated virgins can form themselves into 
associations to observe their commitment more faithfully.^ 

Religious life 

925 Religious life was born in the East during the first centuries of Christianity. Lived within 
institutes canonically erected by the Church, it is distinguished from other forms of consecrated life 
by its liturgical character, public profession of the evangelical counsels, fraternal life led in 
common, and witness given to the union of Christ with the Church.466 ( 1672 ) 

926 Religious life derives from the mystery of the Church. It is a gift she has received from her 
Lord, a gift she offers as a stable way of life to the faithful called by God to profess the counsels. 
Thus, the Church can both show forth Christ and acknowledge herself to be the Savior’s bride. 
Religious life in its various forms is called to signify the very charity of God in the language of our 
time. 1 796 ) 

927 All religious, whether exempt or not, take their place among the collaborators of the diocesan 
bishop in his pastoral duty .469 p r0 m the outset of the work of evangelization, the missionary 
“planting” and expansion of the Church require the presence of the religious life in all its forms.4Z0 
“History witnesses to the outstanding service rendered by religious families in the propagation of 
the faith and in the formation of new Churches: from the ancient monastic institutions to the 
medieval orders, all the way to the more recent congregations. ”4Z1 ( 854 ) 

Secular institutes 

928 “A secular institute is an institute of consecrated life in which the Christian faithful living in 
the world strive for the perfection of charity and work for the sanctification of the world especially 
from within. ”4Z2 


929 By a “life perfectly and entirely consecrated to [such] sanctification,” the members of these 
institutes share in the Church’s task of evangelization, “in the world and from within the world,” 







where their presence acts as “leaven in the world. ”423 “Their witness of a Christian life” aims “to 
order temporal things according to God and inform the world with the power of the gospel.” They 
commit themselves to the evangelical counsels by sacred bonds and observe among themselves the 
communion and fellowship appropriate to their “particular secular way of life. ”424 (901) 

Societies of apostolic life 

930 Alongside the different forms of consecrated life are “societies of apostolic life whose 
members without religious vows pursue the particular apostolic purpose of their society, and lead a 
life as brothers or sisters in common according to a particular manner of life, strive for the 
perfection of charity through the observance of the constitutions. Among these there are societies in 
which the members embrace the evangelical counsels” according to their constitutions. 425 

Consecration and mission: proclaiming the King who is coming 

931 Already dedicated to him through Baptism, the person who surrenders himself to the God he 
loves above all else thereby consecrates himself more intimately to God’s service and to the good 
of the Church. By this state of life consecrated to God, the Church manifests Christ and shows us 
how the Holy Spirit acts so wonderfully in her. And so the first mission of those who profess the 
evangelical counsels is to live out their consecration. Moreover, “since members of institutes of 
consecrated life dedicate themselves through their consecration to the service of the Church they 
are obliged in a special manner to engage in missionary work, in accord with the character of the 
institute. ”425 


932 In the Church, which is like the sacrament—the sign and instrument—of God’s own life, the 
consecrated life is seen as a special sign of the mystery of redemption. To follow and imitate Christ 
more nearly and to manifest more clearly his self-emptying is to be more deeply present to one’s 
contemporaries, in the heart of Christ. For those who are on this “narrower” path encourage their 
brethren by their example, and bear striking witness “that the world cannot be transfigured and 
offered to God without the spirit of the Beatitudes. ”4ZZ ( 775 ) 

933 Whether their witness is public, as in the religious state, or less public, or even secret, Christ’s 
coming remains for all those consecrated both the origin and rising sun of their life: ( 672 . 769 ) 

For the People of God has here no lasting city,... [and this state] reveals more clearly to all 
believers the heavenly goods which are already present in this age, witnessing to the new and 
eternal life which we have acquired through the redemptive work of Christ and preluding our 






future resurrection and the glory of the heavenly kingdom.^ 


IN BRIEF 


934 “Among the Christian faithful by divine institution there exist in the Church sacred ministers, 
who are also called clerics in law, and other Christian faithful who are also called laity.” In both 
groups there are those Christian faithful who, professing the evangelical counsels, are consecrated 
to God and so serve the Church’s saving mission (cf. CIC, can. 207 § 1, 2). 

935 To proclaim the faith and to plant his reign, Christ sends his apostles and their successors. He 
gives them a share in his own mission. From him they receive the power to act in his person. 

936 The Lord made St. Peter the visible foundation of his Church. He entrusted the keys of the 
Church to him. The bishop of the Church of Rome, successor to St. Peter, is “head of the college of 
bishops, the Vicar of Christ and Pastor of the universal Church on earth” (CIC, can. 331). 

937 The Pope enjoys, by divine institution, “supreme, full, immediate, and universal power in the 
care of souls” (CD 2). 

938 The Bishops, established by the Holy Spirit, succeed the apostles. They are “the visible source 
and foundation of unity in their own particular Churches” (LG 23). 

939 Helped by the priests, their co-workers, and by the deacons, the bishops have the duty of 
authentically teaching the faith, celebrating divine worship, above all the Eucharist, and guiding 
their Churches as true pastors. Their responsibility also includes concern for all the Churches, with 
and under the Pope. 

940 “The characteristic of the lay state being a life led in the midst of the world and of secular 
affairs, lay people are called by God to make of their apostolate, through the vigor of their Christian 
spirit, a leaven in the world” (AA 2 § 2). 

941 Lay people share in Christ’s priesthood: ever more united with him, they exhibit the grace of 
Baptism and Confirmation in all dimensions of their personal, family, social, and ecclesial lives, 
and so fulfill the call to holiness addressed to all the baptized. 


942 By virtue of their prophetic mission, lay people “are called... to be witnesses to Christ in all 




circumstances and at the very heart of the community of mankind” (GS 43 § 4). 

943 By virtue of their kingly mission, lay people have the power to uproot the rule of sin within 
themselves and in the world, by their self-denial and holiness of life (cf. LG 36). 

944 The life consecrated to God is characterized by the public profession of the evangelical 
counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience, in a stable state of life recognized by the Church. 

945 Already destined for him through Baptism, the person who surrenders himself to the God he 
loves above all else thereby consecrates himself more intimately to God’s service and to the good 
of the whole Church.

Paragraph 5. The Communion of Saints 1474-1477 


946 After confessing “the holy catholic Church,” the Apostles’ Creed adds “the communion of 
saints.” In a certain sense this article is a further explanation of the preceding: “What is the Church 
if not the assembly of all the saints?”4Z2 The communion of saints is the Church. ( 823 ) 

947 “Since all the faithful form one body, the good of each is communicated to the others.... We 
must therefore believe that there exists a communion of goods in the Church. But the most 
important member is Christ, since he is the head.... Therefore, the riches of Christ are 
communicated to all the members, through the sacraments. ”422 “As this Church is governed by one 
and the same Spirit, all the goods she has received necessarily become a common fund.”421 1 790 1 

948 The term “communion of saints” therefore has two closely linked meanings: communion “in 
holy things ( sancta )” and “among holy persons ( sancti ).” (1331) 

Sancta sanctis! (“God’s holy gifts for God’s holy people”) is proclaimed by the celebrant in 
most Eastern liturgies during the elevation of the holy Gifts before the distribution of 
communion. The faithful ( sancti ) are fed by Christ’s holy body and blood ( sancta ) to grow in 
the communion of the Holy Spirit ( koinonia ) and to communicate it to the world. 

I. Communion in Spiritual Goods 


949 In the primitive community of Jerusalem, the disciples “devoted themselves to the apostles’ 
teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of the bread and the prayers. ”422 (185) 

Communion in the faith. The faith of the faithful is the faith of the Church, received from the 
apostles. Faith is a treasure of life which is enriched by being shared. 

950 Communion of the sacraments. “The fruit of all the sacraments belongs to all the faithful. All 
the sacraments are sacred links uniting the faithful with one another and binding them to Jesus 
Christ, and above all Baptism, the gate by which we enter into the Church. The communion of 
saints must be understood as the communion of the sacraments.... The name ‘communion’ can be 
applied to all of them, for they unite us to God.... But this name is better suited to the Eucharist than 
to any other, because it is primarily the Eucharist that brings this communion about. ”422 (1130, 

1331) 


951 Communion of charisms. Within the communion of the Church, the Holy Spirit “distributes 









special graces among the faithful of every rank” for the building up of the Church.^ Now, “to 
each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.”^ (799) 


952 “They had everything in common .”486 “Everything the true Christian has is to be regarded as a 
good possessed in common with everyone else. All Christians should be ready and eager to come to 
the help of the needy... and of their neighbors in want.”— A Christian is a steward of the Lord’s 
goods.428 (2402) 

953 Communion in charity. In the sanctorum communio, “None of us lives to himself, and none of 
us dies to himself.”^ “If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all 
rejoice together. Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.”49Q “Charity does 
not insist on its own way. ”491 In this solidarity with all men, living or dead, which is founded on 
the communion of saints, the least of our acts done in charity redounds to the profit of all. Every sin 
harms this communion. ( 1827 . 2011 . 845 . 1469 1 

II. The Communion of the Church of Heaven and Earth 


954 The three states of the Church. “When the Lord comes in glory, and all his angels with him, 
death will be no more and all things will be subject to him. But at the present time some of his 
disciples are pilgrims on earth. Others have died and are being purified, while still others are in 
glory, contemplating ‘in full light, God himself triune and one, exactly as he is’”:^2 (771, 1031 . 
1023 1 

All of us, however, in varying degrees and in different ways share in the same charity towards 
God and our neighbours, and we all sing the one hymn of glory to our God. All, indeed, who 
are of Christ and who have his Spirit form one Church and in Christ cleave together.^3 

955 “So it is that the union of the wayfarers with the brethren who sleep in the peace of Christ is in 
no way interrupted, but on the contrary, according to the constant faith of the Church, this union is 
reinforced by an exchange of spiritual goods. 

956 The intercession of the saints. “Being more closely united to Christ, those who dwell in heaven 
fix the whole Church more firmly in holiness.... [T]hey do not cease to intercede with the Father for 
us, as they proffer the merits which they acquired on earth through the one mediator between God 
and men, Christ Jesus.... So by their fraternal concern is our weakness greatly helped.”^ (1370, 
2683 1 













Do not weep, for I shall be more useful to you after my death and I shall help you then more 
effectively than during my life.^Sh 

I want to spend my heaven in doing good on earth.^TZ 

957 Communion with the saints. “It is not merely by the title of example that we cherish the 
memory of those in heaven; we seek, rather, that by this devotion to the exercise of fraternal charity 
the union of the whole Church in the Spirit may be strengthened. Exactly as Christian communion 
among our fellow pilgrims brings us closer to Christ, so our communion with the saints joins us to 
Christ, from whom as from its fountain and head issues all grace, and the life of the People of God 

itself’498; ( H73 ) 

We worship Christ as God’s Son; we love the martyrs as the Lord’s disciples and imitators, 
and rightly so because of their matchless devotion towards their king and master. May we also 
be their companions and fellow disciples !^9 

958 Communion with the dead. “In full consciousness of this communion of the whole Mystical 
Body of Jesus Christ, the Church in its pilgrim members, from the very earliest days of the 
Christian religion, has honored with great respect the memory of the dead; and ‘because it is a holy 
and a wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be loosed from their sins’ she offers 
her suffrages for them.”^22 Our prayer for them is capable not only of helping them, but also of 
making their intercession for us effective. ( 1371 . 1032 . 1689 1 

959 In the one family of God. “For if we continue to love one another and to join in praising the 
Most Holy Trinity—all of us who are sons of God and form one family in Christ—we will be 
faithful to the deepest vocation of the Church.”^ (1027) 


IN BRIEF 


960 The Church is a “communion of saints”: this expression refers first to the “holy things” 
(sancta), above all the Eucharist, by which “the unity of believers, who form one body in Christ, is 
both represented and brought about” (LG 3). 

961 The term “communion of saints” refers also to the communion of “holy persons” ( sancti ) in 
Christ who “died for all,” so that what each one does or suffers in and for Christ bears fruit for all. 









962 “We believe in the communion of all the faithful of Christ, those who are pilgrims on earth, the 
dead who are being purified, and the blessed in heaven, all together forming one Church; and we 
believe that in this communion, the merciful love of God and his saints is always [attentive] to our 
prayers” (Paul VI, CPG § 30).

Paragraph 6. Mary—Mother of Christ, Mother of the Church 


963 Since the Virgin Mary’s role in the mystery of Christ and the Spirit has been treated, it is fitting 
now to consider her place in the mystery of the Church. “The Virgin Mary... is acknowledged and 
honored as being truly the Mother of God and of the redeemer.... She is ‘clearly the mother of the 
members of Christ’... since she has by her charity joined in bringing about the birth of believers in 
the Church, who are members of its head.”^Q2 “Mary, Mother of Christ, Mother of the Church.’’^ 
( 484-507 . 721-726 1 

I. Mary’s Motherhood with Regard to the Church 


Wholly united with her Son... 

964 Mary’s role in the Church is inseparable from her union with Christ and flows directly from it. 
“This union of the mother with the Son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of 
Christ’s virginal conception up to his death”; ^4 it is made manifest above all at the hour of his 
Passion: (534, 618 1 

Thus the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and faithfully persevered in her 
union with her Son unto the cross. There she stood, in keeping with the divine plan, enduring 
with her only begotten Son the intensity of his suffering, joining herself with his sacrifice in 
her mother’s heart, and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this victim, born of her: to be 
given, by the same Christ Jesus dying on the cross, as a mother to his disciple, with these 
words: “Woman, behold your son.”^ 

965 After her Son’s Ascension, Mary “aided the beginnings of the Church by her prayers. ”^6 
her association with the apostles and several women, “we also see Mary by her prayers imploring 
the gift of the Spirit, who had already overshadowed her in the Annunciation.”^ 

...also in her Assumption 

966 “Finally the Immaculate Virgin, preserved free from all stain of original sin, when the course 
of her earthly life was finished, was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by the 
Lord as Queen over all things, so that she might be the more fully conformed to her Son, the Lord 
of lords and conqueror of sin and death.”^ The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin is a singular 
participation in her Son’s Resurrection and an anticipation of the resurrection of other Christians: 






(491) 


In giving birth you kept your virginity; in your Dormition you did not leave the world, O 
Mother of God, but were joined to the source of Life. You conceived the living God and, by 
your prayers, will deliver our souls from death.^2 

...she is our Mother in the order of grace 

967 By her complete adherence to the Father’s will, to his Son’s redemptive work, and to every 
prompting of the Holy Spirit, the Virgin Mary is the Church’s model of faith and charity. Thus she 
is a “preeminent and... wholly unique member of the Church”; indeed, she is the “exemplary 
realization” ( typus )^1Q of the Church. (2679, 507) 

968 Her role in relation to the Church and to all humanity goes still further. “In a wholly singular 
way she cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope, and burning charity in the Savior’s work of 
restoring supernatural life to souls. For this reason she is a mother to us in the order of grace. 

(494) 

969 “This motherhood of Mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly from the consent 
which she loyally gave at the Annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the 
cross, until the eternal fulfilment of all the elect. Taken up to heaven she did not lay aside this 
saving office but by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation.... 
Therefore the Blessed Virgin is invoked in the Church under the titles of Advocate, Helper, 
Benefactress, and Mediatrix.”^ (149, 501, 1370 1 

970 “Mary’s function as mother of men in no way obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of 
Christ, but rather shows its power. But the Blessed Virgin’s salutary influence on men... flows forth 
from the superabundance of the merits of Christ, rests on his mediation, depends entirely on it, and 
draws all its power from it.”S13 “No creature could ever be counted along with the Incarnate Word 
and Redeemer; but just as the priesthood of Christ is shared in various ways both by his ministers 
and the faithful, and as the one goodness of God is radiated in different ways among his creatures, 
so also the unique mediation of the Redeemer does not exclude but rather gives rise to a manifold 
cooperation which is but a sharing in this one source.”^ ( 2008 . 1545 . 308 1 

II. Devotion to the Blessed Virgin 2673-2679 


971 “All generations will call me blessed”: “The Church’s devotion to the Blessed Virgin is 














intrinsic to Christian worship.”^ The Church rightly honors “the Blessed Virgin with special 
devotion. From the most ancient times the Blessed Virgin has been honored with the title of 
'Mother of God,’ to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs.... This very 
special devotion... differs essentially from the adoration which is given to the incarnate Word and 
equally to the Father and the Holy Spirit, and greatly fosters this adoration.”^ The liturgical feasts 
dedicated to the Mother of God and Marian prayer, such as the rosary, an “epitome of the whole 
Gospel,” express this devotion to the Virgin Mary.-^Z ( 1172 . 2678 1 

III. Mary—Eschatological Icon of the Church 


972 After speaking of the Church, her origin, mission, and destiny, we can find no better way to 
conclude than by looking to Mary. In her we contemplate what the Church already is in her mystery 
on her own “pilgrimage of faith,” and what she will be in the homeland at the end of her journey. 
There, “in the glory of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity,” “in the communion of all the 
saints, ”^18 the Church is awaited by the one she venerates as Mother of her Lord and as her own 
mother. (773, 829, 2853 1 

In the meantime the Mother of Jesus, in the glory which she possesses in body and soul in 
heaven, is the image and beginning of the Church as it is to be perfected in the world to come. 
Likewise she shines forth on earth, until the day of the Lord shall come, a sign of certain hope 
and comfort to the pilgrim People of God.^ 


IN BRIEF 


973 By pronouncing her “fiat” at the Annunciation and giving her consent to the Incarnation, Mary 
was already collaborating with the whole work her Son was to accomplish. She is mother wherever 
he is Savior and head of the Mystical Body. 

974 The Most Blessed Virgin Mary, when the course of her earthly life was completed, was taken 
up body and soul into the glory of heaven, where she already shares in the glory of her Son’s 
Resurrection, anticipating the resurrection of all members of his Body. 

975 “We believe that the Holy Mother of God, the new Eve, Mother of the Church, continues in 
heaven to exercise her maternal role on behalf of the members of Christ” (Paul VI, CPG § 15). 











ARTICLE 10 

“I BELIEVE IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS” 


976 The Apostle’s Creed associates faith in the forgiveness of sins not only with faith in the Holy 
Spirit, but also with faith in the Church and in the communion of saints. It was when he gave the 
Holy Spirit to his apostles that the risen Christ conferred on them his own divine power to forgive 
sins: “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the 
sins of any, they are retained.”^ 

(Part Two of the catechism will deal explicitly with the forgiveness of sins through Baptism, 
the sacrament of Penance, and the other sacraments, especially the Eucharist. Here it will 
suffice to suggest some basic facts briefly.) 

I. One Baptism for the Forgiveness of Sins 1263 

977 Our Lord tied the forgiveness of sins to faith and Baptism: “Go into all the world and preach 
the gospel to the whole creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved.”52I Baptism is the 
first and chief sacrament of forgiveness of sins because it unites us with Christ, who died for our 
sins and rose for our justification, so that “we too might walk in newness of life. ”522 

978 “When we made our first profession of faith while receiving the holy Baptism that cleansed us, 
the forgiveness we received then was so full and complete that there remained in us absolutely 
nothing left to efface, neither original sin nor offenses committed by our own will, nor was there 
left any penalty to suffer in order to expiate them.... Yet the grace of Baptism delivers no one from 
all the weakness of nature. On the contrary, we must still combat the movements of concupiscence 
that never cease leading us into evil. ”523 (1264) 

979 In this battle against our inclination towards evil, who could be brave and watchful enough to 
escape every wound of sin? “If the Church has the power to forgive sins, then Baptism cannot be 
her only means of using the keys of the Kingdom of heaven received from Jesus Christ. The 
Church must be able to forgive all penitents their offenses, even if they should sin until the last 
moment of their lives. ”524 ( 1446 ) 


980 It is through the sacrament of Penance that the baptized can be reconciled with God and with 
the Church: 1 1422-1484 1 








Penance has rightly been called by the holy Fathers “a laborious kind of baptism.” This 
sacrament of Penance is necessary for salvation for those who have fallen after Baptism, just 
as Baptism is necessary for salvation for those who have not yet been reborn.^ 

II. The Power of the Keys 

981 After his Resurrection, Christ sent his apostles “so that repentance and forgiveness of sins 
should be preached in his name to all nations.”^ The apostles and their successors carry out this 
“ministry of reconciliation,” not only by announcing to men God’s forgiveness merited for us by 
Christ, and calling them to conversion and faith; but also by communicating to them the 
forgiveness of sins in Baptism, and reconciling them with God and with the Church through the 
power of the keys, received from Christ:^ (1444, 553) 

[The Church] has received the keys of the Kingdom of heaven so that, in her, sins may be 
forgiven through Christ’s blood and the Holy Spirit’s action. In this Church, the soul dead 
through sin comes back to life in order to live with Christ, whose grace has saved us. ^8 

982 There is no offense, however serious, that the Church cannot forgive. “There is no one, 
however wicked and guilty, who may not confidently hope for forgiveness, provided his repentance 
is honest.”^ Christ who died for all men desires that in his Church the gates of forgiveness should 
always be open to anyone who turns away from sin.^Q ( 1463 . 605) 

983 Catechesis strives to awaken and nourish in the faithful faith in the incomparable greatness of 
the risen Christ’s gift to his Church: the mission and the power to forgive sins through the ministry 
of the apostles and their successors: ( 1442 . 1465 1 

The Lord wills that his disciples possess a tremendous power: that his lowly servants 
accomplish in his name all that he did when he was on earth.^TL 

Priests have received from God a power that he has given neither to angels nor to 
archangels.... God above confirms what priests do here below.^2 

Were there no forgiveness of sins in the Church, there would be no hope of life to come or 
eternal liberation. Let us thank God who has given his Church such a gift.^&gt; 


IN BRIEF 










984 The Creed links “the forgiveness of sins” with its profession of faith in the Holy Spirit, for the 
risen Christ entrusted to the apostles the power to forgive sins when he gave them the Holy Spirit. 

985 Baptism is the first and chief sacrament of the forgiveness of sins: it unites us to Christ, who 
died and rose, and gives us the Holy Spirit. 

986 By Christ’s will, the Church possesses the power to forgive the sins of the baptized and 
exercises it through bishops and priests normally in the sacrament of Penance. 

987 “In the forgiveness of sins, both priests and sacraments are instruments which our Lord Jesus 
Christ, the only author and liberal giver of salvation, wills to use in order to efface our sins and give 
us the grace of justification” ( Roman Catechism, I, 11, 6 ).

ARTICLE 11 


“I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY” 


988 The Christian Creed—the profession of our faith in God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy 
Spirit, and in God’s creative, saving, and sanctifying action—culminates in the proclamation of the 
resurrection of the dead on the last day and in life everlasting. 

989 We firmly believe, and hence we hope that, just as Christ is truly risen from the dead and lives 
for ever, so after death the righteous will live for ever with the risen Christ and he will raise them 
up on the last day.^4 Our resurrection, like his own, will be the work of the Most Holy Trinity: 
( 655 . 648) 

If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus 
from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you.^ 

990 The term “flesh” refers to man in his state of weakness and mortality.^ The “resurrection of 
the flesh” (the literal formulation of the Apostles’ Creed) means not only that the immortal soul 
will live on after death, but that even our “mortal body” will come to life again. ^ (364) 

991 Belief in the resurrection of the dead has been an essential element of the Christian faith from 
its beginnings. “The confidence of Christians is the resurrection of the dead; believing this we 
live.”538 ( 638 ) 


How can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no 
resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised; if Christ has not been raised, then our 
preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.... But in fact Christ has been raised from the 
dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.^ 

I. Christ’s Resurrection and Ours 

The progressive revelation of the Resurrection 

992 God revealed the resurrection of the dead to his people progressively. Hope in the bodily 
resurrection of the dead established itself as a consequence intrinsic to faith in God as creator of the 
whole man, soul and body. The creator of heaven and earth is also the one who faithfully maintains 
his covenant with Abraham and his posterity. It was in this double perspective that faith in the 
resurrection came to be expressed. In their trials, the Maccabean martyrs confessed: ( 297 1 









The King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have 
died for his laws.^40 One cannot but choose to die at the hands of men and to cherish the hope 
that God gives of being raised again by him.^i 

993 The Pharisees and many of the Lord’s contemporaries hoped for the resurrection. Jesus teaches 
it firmly. To the Sadducees who deny it he answers, “Is not this why you are wrong, that you know 
neither the scriptures nor the power of God?”^2 Faith in the resurrection rests on faith in God who 
“is not God of the dead, but of the living.”^ ( 575 . 205 1 

994 But there is more. Jesus links faith in the resurrection to his own person: “I am the 
Resurrection and the life. ”^44 it [ s Jesus himself who on the last day will raise up those who have 
believed in him, who have eaten his body and drunk his blood.^ Already now in this present life 
he gives a sign and pledge of this by restoring some of the dead to life, ^6 announcing thereby his 
own Resurrection, though it was to be of another order. He speaks of this unique event as the “sign 
of Jonah,the sign of the temple: he announces that he will be put to death but rise thereafter on 
the third day.^L (646) 

995 To be a witness to Christ is to be a “witness to his Resurrection,” to “[have eaten and drunk] 
with him after he rose from the dead.”^ Encounters with the risen Christ characterize the 
Christian hope of resurrection. We shall rise like Christ, with him, and through him. (860, 655 1 

996 From the beginning, Christian faith in the resurrection has met with incomprehension and 
opposition.^ “On no point does the Christian faith encounter more opposition than on the 
resurrection of the body.”^i It is very commonly accepted that the life of the human person 
continues in a spiritual fashion after death. But how can we believe that this body, so clearly 
mortal, could rise to everlasting life? (643) 

How do the dead rise? 

997 What is “rising ” ? In death, the separation of the soul from the body, the human body decays 
and the soul goes to meet God, while awaiting its reunion with its glorified body. God, in his 
almighty power, will definitively grant incorruptible life to our bodies by reuniting them with our 
souls, through the power of Jesus’ Resurrection. (366) 

998 Who will rise? All the dead will rise, “those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, 
and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.”^ [ 1038 1 










999 How? Christ is raised with his own body: “See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself”;^ 
but he did not return to an earthly life. So, in him, “all of them will rise again with their own bodies 
which they now bear,” but Christ “will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body,” into a 
“spiritual body”:^4 ( 640 . 645) 

But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?” You 
foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the 
body which is to be, but a bare kernel.... What is sown is perishable, what is raised is 
imperishable.... The dead will be raised imperishable.... For this perishable nature must put on 
the imperishable, and this mortal nature must put on immortality.^ 

1000 This “how” exceeds our imagination and understanding; it is accessible only to faith. Yet our 
participation in the Eucharist already gives us a foretaste of Christ’s transfiguration of our bodies: 
( 647 .1405) 

Just as bread that comes from the earth, after God’s blessing has been invoked upon it, is no 
longer ordinary bread, but Eucharist, formed of two things, the one earthly and the other 
heavenly: so too our bodies, which partake of the Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, but 
possess the hope of resurrection.^ 

1001 When? Definitively “at the last day,” “at the end of the world.”^ Indeed, the resurrection of 
the dead is closely associated with Christ’s Parousia: ( 1038 . 673) 

For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a cry of command, with the archangel’s 
call, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. ^ 

Risen with Christ 

1002 Christ will raise us up “on the last day”; but it is also true that, in a certain way, we have 
already risen with Christ. For, by virtue of the Holy Spirit, Christian life is already now on earth a 
participation in the death and Resurrection of Christ: (655) 

And you were buried with him in Baptism, in which you were also raised with him through 
faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.... If then you have been raised 
with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.^ 


1003 United with Christ by Baptism, believers already truly participate in the heavenly life of the 









risen Christ, but this life remains “hidden with Christ in God.”^ The Father has already “raised us 
up with him, and made us sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Nourished with 
his body in the Eucharist, we already belong to the Body of Christ. When we rise on the last day we 
“also will appear with him in glory.”^2 ( 1227 . 2796 1 

1004 In expectation of that day, the believer’s body and soul already participate in the dignity of 
belonging to Christ. This dignity entails the demand that he should treat with respect his own body, 
but also the body of every other person, especially the suffering: (364, 1397 1 

The body [is meant] for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God raised the Lord and will 
also raise us up by his power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?... 
You are not your own;... So glorify God in your body. 

II. Dying in Christ Jesus 

1005 To rise with Christ, we must die with Christ: we must “be away from the body and at home 
with the Lord.”^4 i n that “departure” which is death the soul is separated from the body.^ It will 
be reunited with the body on the day of resurrection of the dead.^ 1 650 1 

Death 

1006 “It is in regard to death that man’s condition is most shrouded in doubt.”^ In a sense bodily 
death is natural, but for faith it is in fact “the wages of sin.”^h8 p or those who die in Christ’s grace 
it is a participation in the death of the Lord, so that they can also share his Resurrection.^ 

1007 Death is the end of earthly life. Our lives are measured by time, in the course of which we 
change, grow old and, as with all living beings on earth, death seems like the normal end of life. 
That aspect of death lends urgency to our lives: remembering our mortality helps us realize that we 
have only a limited time in which to bring our lives to fulfillment: 

Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,... before the dust returns to the earth as 
it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.^Q 

1008 Death is a consequence of sin. The Church’s Magisterium, as authentic interpreter of the 
affirmations of Scripture and Tradition, teaches that death entered the world on account of man’s 
sin.^i Even though man’s nature is mortal, God had destined him not to die. Death was therefore 
contrary to the plans of God the Creator and entered the world as a consequence of sin.^2 “Bodily 







death, from which man would have been immune had he not sinned” is thus “the last enemy” of 
man left to be conquered.^ (401, 376 1 


1009 Death is transformed by Christ. Jesus, the Son of God, also himself suffered the death that is 
part of the human condition. Yet, despite his anguish as he faced death, he accepted it in an act of 
complete and free submission to his Father’s will. ^4 The obedience of Jesus has transformed the 
curse of death into a blessing.^? ( 612 1 

The meaning of Christian death 1681-1690 

1010 Because of Christ, Christian death has a positive meaning: “For to me to live is Christ, and to 
die is gain.”^6 “The saying is sure: if we have died with him, we will also live with him.”4ZZ What 
is essentially new about Christian death is this: through Baptism, the Christian has already “died 
with Christ” sacramentally, in order to live a new life; and if we die in Christ’s grace, physical 
death completes this “dying with Christ” and so completes our incorporation into him in his 
redeeming act: 1 1220 1 

It is better for me to die in (ezs) Christ Jesus than to reign over the ends of the earth. Him it is I 
seek—who died for us. Him it is I desire—who rose for us. I am on the point of giving birth.... 
Let me receive pure light; when I shall have arrived there, then shall I be a man.^ 

1011 In death, God calls man to himself. Therefore the Christian can experience a desire for death 
like St. Paul’s: “My desire is to depart and be with Christ.”^ He can transform his own death into 
an act of obedience and love towards the Father, after the example of Christ:^ ( 1025 1 

My earthly desire has been crucified;... there is living water in me, water that murmurs and 
says within me: Come to the Father.^- 

I want to see God and, in order to see him, I must die. ^2 

I am not dying; I am entering life.^23 

1012 The Christian vision of death receives privileged expression in the liturgy of the Church:^ 

Lord, for your faithful people life is changed, not ended. 

When the body of our earthly dwelling lies in death 
we gain an everlasting dwelling place in heaven.^ 









1013 Death is the end of man’s earthly pilgrimage, of the time of grace and mercy which God 
offers him so as to work out his earthly life in keeping with the divine plan, and to decide his 
ultimate destiny. When “the single course of our earthly life” is completed,^ we shall not return 
to other earthly lives: “It is appointed for men to die once.”^ There is no “reincarnation” after 
death. 

1014 The Church encourages us to prepare ourselves for the hour of our death. In the ancient litany 
of the saints, for instance, she has us pray: “From a sudden and unforeseen death, deliver us, O 
Lord”;^8 to ask the Mother of God to intercede for us “at the hour of our death” in the Hail Mary; 
and to entrust ourselves to St. Joseph, the patron of a happy death. 1 2676-2677 1 

Every action of yours, every thought, should be those of one who expects to die before the day 
is out. Death would have no great terrors for you if you had a quiet conscience.... Then why 
not keep clear of sin instead of running away from death? If you aren’t fit to face death today, 
it’s very unlikely you will be tomorrow.... ^ 

Praised are you, my Lord, for our sister bodily Death, 
from whom no living man can escape. 

Woe on those who will die in mortal sin! 

Blessed are they who will be found 

in your most holy will, 

for the second death will not harm them.^90 


IN BRIEF 

1015 “The flesh is the hinge of salvation” (Tertullian, De res. 8, 2: PL 2, 852). We believe in God 
who is creator of the flesh; we believe in the Word made flesh in order to redeem the flesh; we 
believe in the resurrection of the flesh, the fulfillment of both the creation and the redemption of the 
flesh. 

1016 By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the resurrection God will give 
incorruptible life to our body, transformed by reunion with our soul. Just as Christ is risen and lives 
for ever, so all of us will rise at the last day. 


1017 “We believe in the true resurrection of this flesh that we now possess” (Council of Lyons II: 





DS 854). We sow a corruptible body in the tomb, but he raises up an incorruptible body, a 
“spiritual body” (cf. 1 Cor 15:42-44). 

1018 As a consequence of original sin, man must suffer “bodily death, from which man would have 
been immune had he not sinned” (GS § 18). 

1019 Jesus, the Son of God, freely suffered death for us in complete and free submission to the will 
of God, his Father. By his death he has conquered death, and so opened the possibility of salvation 
to all men.

“I BELIEVE IN LIFE EVERLASTING” 


1020 The Christian who unites his own death to that of Jesus views it as a step towards him and an 
entrance into everlasting life. When the Church for the last time speaks Christ’s words of pardon 
and absolution over the dying Christian, seals him for the last time with a strengthening anointing, 
and gives him Christ in viaticum as nourishment for the journey, she speaks with gentle assurance: 
1 1523-1525 . 2677 . 336) 

Go forth, Christian soul, from this world 
in the name of God the almighty Father, 
who created you, 

in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, 

who suffered for you, 

in the name of the Holy Spirit, 

who was poured out upon you. 

Go forth, faithful Christian! 

May you live in peace this day, 
may your home be with God in Zion, 
with Mary, the virgin Mother of God, 
with Joseph, and all the angels and saints.... 

May you return to [your Creator] 

who formed you from the dust of the earth. 

May holy Mary, the angels, and all the saints 
come to meet you as you go forth from this life.... 

May you see your Redeemer face to face.... STL 


I. The Particular Judgment 







1021 Death puts an end to human life as the time open to either accepting or rejecting the divine 
grace manifested in Christ.^2 The New Testament speaks of judgment primarily in its aspect of the 
final encounter with Christ in his second coming, but also repeatedly affirms that each will be 
rewarded immediately after death in accordance with his works and faith. The parable of the poor 
man Lazarus and the words of Christ on the cross to the good thief, as well as other New Testament 
texts speak of a final destiny of the soul—a destiny which can be different for some and for 
others .523 (679) 

1022 Each man receives his eternal retribution in his immortal soul at the very moment of his 
death, in a particular judgment that refers his life to Christ: either entrance into the blessedness of 
heaven—through a purification^ or immediately,525—or immediate and everlasting 
damnation.^ ( 393 , 1470) 

At the evening of life, we shall be judged on our love.52Z 

II. Heaven 

1023 Those who die in God’s grace and friendship and are perfectly purified live for ever with 
Christ. They are like God for ever, for they “see him as he is,” face to face;522 ( 954 ) 

By virtue of our apostolic authority, we define the following: According to the general 
disposition of God, the souls of all the saints... and other faithful who died after receiving 
Christ’s holy Baptism (provided they were not in need of purification when they died,... or, if 
they then did need or will need some purification, when they have been purified after death,... 

) already before they take up their bodies again and before the general judgment—and this 
since the Ascension of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ into heaven—have been, are and will 
be in heaven, in the heavenly Kingdom and celestial paradise with Christ, joined to the 
company of the holy angels. Since the Passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ, these souls 
have seen and do see the divine essence with an intuitive vision, and even face to face, without 
the mediation of any creature.522 

1024 This perfect life with the Most Holy Trinity—this communion of life and love with the 
Trinity, with the Virgin Mary, the angels and all the blessed—is called “heaven.” Heaven is the 
ultimate end and fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, definitive 
happiness. (260, 326, 2794, 1718 1 


1025 To live in heaven is “to be with Christ.” The elect live “in Christ, ”522 but they retain, or rather 










find, their true identity, their own name.hhi (1011) 


For life is to be with Christ; where Christ is, there is life, there is the kingdom.^ 

1026 By his death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ has “opened” heaven to us. The life of the blessed 
consists in the full and perfect possession of the fruits of the redemption accomplished by Christ. 
He makes partners in his heavenly glorification those who have believed in him and remained 
faithful to his will. Heaven is the blessed community of all who are perfectly incorporated into 
Christ. 1 793 1 

1027 This mystery of blessed communion with God and all who are in Christ is beyond all 
understanding and description. Scripture speaks of it in images: life, light, peace, wedding feast, 
wine of the kingdom, the Father’s house, the heavenly Jerusalem, paradise: “no eye has seen, nor 
ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him.”h23 
1 959 . 1720 1 

1028 Because of his transcendence, God cannot be seen as he is, unless he himself opens up his 
mystery to man’s immediate contemplation and gives him the capacity for it. The Church calls this 
contemplation of God in his heavenly glory “the beatific vision”: 1 1722 . 163 1 

How great will your glory and happiness be, to be allowed to see God, to be honored with 
sharing the joy of salvation and eternal light with Christ your Lord and God,... to delight in the 
joy of immortality in the Kingdom of heaven with the righteous and God’s friends.^ 

1029 In the glory of heaven the blessed continue joyfully to fulfill God’s will in relation to other 
men and to all creation. Already they reign with Christ; with him “they shall reign for ever and 
ever.”6Q5 ( 956 , 668) 

III. The Final Purification, or Purgatory 

1030 All who die in God’s grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of 
their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness 
necessary to enter the joy of heaven. 

1031 The Church gives the name Purgatory to this final purification of the elect, which is entirely 
different from the punishment of the damned.^ The Church formulated her doctrine of faith on 
Purgatory especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. The tradition of the Church, by 










reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a cleansing fire:^Z ( 954 . 1472 1 


As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the Final Judgment, there is a 
purifying fire. He who is truth says that whoever utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will 
be pardoned neither in this age nor in the age to come. From this sentence we understand that 
certain offenses can be forgiven in this age, but certain others in the age to come.^ 

1032 This teaching is also based on the practice of prayer for the dead, already mentioned in Sacred 
Scripture: “Therefore [Judas Maccabeus] made atonement for the dead, that they might be 
delivered from their sin.”hH From the beginning the Church has honored the memory of the dead 
and offered prayers in suffrage for them, above all the Eucharistic sacrifice, so that, thus purified, 
they may attain the beatific vision of God.hlh The Church also commends almsgiving, indulgences, 
and works of penance undertaken on behalf of the dead: (958, 1371 . 1479 1 

Let us help and commemorate them. If Job’s sons were purified by their father’s sacrifice, why 
would we doubt that our offerings for the dead bring them some consolation? Let us not 
hesitate to help those who have died and to offer our prayers for them.hH 

IV. Hell 

1033 We cannot be united with God unless we freely choose to love him. But we cannot love God 
if we sin gravely against him, against our neighbor or against ourselves: “He who does not love 
remains in death. Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has 
eternal life abiding in him.”hl2 Our Lord warns us that we shall be separated from him if we fail to 
meet the serious needs of the poor and the little ones who are his brethren.^ To die in mortal sin 
without repenting and accepting God’s merciful love means remaining separated from him for ever 
by our own free choice. This state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the 
blessed is called “hell.” ( 1861 . 393 . 633) 

1034 Jesus often speaks of “Gehenna,” of “the unquenchable fire” reserved for those who to the 
end of their lives refuse to believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost.hM Jesus 
solemnly proclaims that he “will send his angels, and they will gather... all evil doers, and throw 
them into the furnace of fire,”h!5 anc [ that he will pronounce the condemnation: “Depart from me, 
you cursed, into the eternal fire!”^ 

1035 The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its eternity. Immediately after 
death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the 










punishments of hell, “eternal fire. ”^12 The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, 
in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he 
longs. (393) 

1036 The affirmations of Sacred Scripture and the teachings of the Church on the subject of hell are 
a call to the responsibility incumbent upon man to make use of his freedom in view of his eternal 
destiny. They are at the same time an urgent call to conversion: “Enter by the narrow gate; for the 
gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For 
the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.”^ ( 1734 . 
1428 1 

Since we know neither the day nor the hour, we should follow the advice of the Lord and 
watch constantly so that, when the single course of our earthly life is completed, we may merit 
to enter with him into the marriage feast and be numbered among the blessed, and not, like the 
wicked and slothful servants, be ordered to depart into the eternal fire, into the outer darkness 
where “men will weep and gnash their teeth.”^ 

1037 God predestines no one to go to hell;^ for this, a willful turning away from God (a mortal 
sin) is necessary, and persistence in it until the end. In the Eucharistic liturgy and in the daily 
prayers of her faithful, the Church implores the mercy of God, who does not want “any to perish, 
but all to come to repentance”:^! ( 162 . 1014 . 1821 . 678-679 1 

Father, accept this offering 
from your whole family. 

Grant us your peace in this life, 

save us from final damnation, 

and count us among those you have chosen.h22 

V. The Last Judgment 

1038 The resurrection of all the dead, “of both the just and the unjust, ”§^3 w ill precede the Last 
Judgment. This will be “the hour when all who are in the tombs will hear [the Son of man’s] voice 
and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done 
evil, to the resurrection of judgment.”^ Then Christ will come “in his glory, and all the angels 
with him.... Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one from another 
as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will place the sheep at his right hand, but 









the goats at the left.... And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal 
life ”625 (1001, 998) 


1039 In the presence of Christ, who is Truth itself, the truth of each man’s relationship with God 
will be laid bare.^ The Last Judgment will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each 
person has done or failed to do during his earthly life: (678) 

All that the wicked do is recorded, and they do not know. When “our God comes, he does not 
keep silence.”... he will turn towards those at his left hand:...” I placed my poor little ones on 
earth for you. I as their head was seated in heaven at the right hand of my Father—but on earth 
my members were suffering, my members on earth were in need. If you gave anything to my 
members, what you gave would reach their Head. Would that you had known that my little 
ones were in need when I placed them on earth for you and appointed them your stewards to 
bring your good works into my treasury. But you have placed nothing in their hands; therefore 
you have found nothing in my presence. ”h2Z 

1040 The Last Judgment will come when Christ returns in glory. Only the Father knows the day 
and the hour; only he determines the moment of its coming. Then through his Son Jesus Christ he 
will pronounce the final word on all history. We shall know the ultimate meaning of the whole 
work of creation and of the entire economy of salvation and understand the marvellous ways by 
which his Providence led everything towards its final end. The Last Judgment will reveal that 
God’s justice triumphs over all the injustices committed by his creatures and that God’s love is 
stronger than death.^ (637, 314 1 

1041 The message of the Last Judgment calls men to conversion while God is still giving them “the 
acceptable time,... the day of salvation.”^ it inspires a holy fear of God and commits them to the 
justice of the Kingdom of God. It proclaims the “blessed hope” of the Lord’s return, when he will 
come “to be glorified in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all who have believed.”^ ( 1432 1 

VI. The Hope of the New Heaven and the New Earth 2854 

1042 At the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in its fullness. After the universal 
judgment, the righteous will reign for ever with Christ, glorified in body and soul. The universe 
itself will be renewed: ( 769 . 670 . 310 ) 


The Church... will receive her perfection only in the glory of heaven, when will come the time 
of the renewal of all things. At that time, together with the human race, the universe itself, 












which is so closely related to man and which attains its destiny through him, will be perfectly 
re-established in Christ.^i 

1043 Sacred Scripture calls this mysterious renewal, which will transform humanity and the world, 
“new heavens and a new earth.”^2 it will be the definitive realization of God’s plan to bring under 
a single head “all things in [Christ], things in heaven and things on earth.§33 ( 671 . 280 . 518 ] 

1044 In this new universe, the heavenly Jerusalem, God will have his dwelling among men.^4 “He 
will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be 
mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away.”^ 

1045 For man, this consummation will be the final realization of the unity of the human race, 
which God willed from creation and of which the pilgrim Church has been “in the nature of 
sacrament. Those who are united with Christ will form the community of the redeemed, “the 
holy city” of God, “the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.”^ She will not be wounded any longer by 
sin, stains, self-love, that destroy or wound the earthly community.^ The beatific vision, in which 
God opens himself in an inexhaustible way to the elect, will be the ever-flowing well-spring of 
happiness, peace, and mutual communion. (775, 1404 ) 

1046 For the cosmos, Revelation affirms the profound common destiny of the material world and 
man: ( 349 ] 

For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God... in hope 
because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay.... We know that the 
whole creation has been groaning in travail together until now; and not only the creation, but 
we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait for adoption as 
sons, the redemption of our bodies.^ 

1047 The visible universe, then, is itself destined to be transformed, “so that the world itself, 
restored to its original state, facing no further obstacles, should be at the service of the just,” 
sharing their glorification in the risen Jesus Christ.^ 

1048 “We know neither the moment of the consummation of the earth and of man, nor the way in 
which the universe will be transformed. The form of this world, distorted by sin, is passing away, 
and we are taught that God is preparing a new dwelling and a new earth in which righteousness 
dwells, in which happiness will fill and surpass all the desires of peace arising in the hearts of 
men .”641 ( 673 ] 









1049 “Far from diminishing our concern to develop this earth, the expectancy of a new earth should 
spur us on, for it is here that the body of a new human family grows, foreshadowing in some way 
the age which is to come. That is why, although we must be careful to distinguish earthly progress 
clearly from the increase of the kingdom of Christ, such progress is of vital concern to the kingdom 
of God, insofar as it can contribute to the better ordering of human society.”h42 ( 2820 1 

1050 “When we have spread on earth the fruits of our nature and our enterprise... according to the 
command of the Lord and in his Spirit, we will find them once again, cleansed this time from the 
stain of sin, illuminated and transfigured, when Christ presents to his Father an eternal and 
universal kingdom.”h43 God will then be “all in all” in eternal life:§44 (1709, 260 1 

True and subsistent life consists in this: the Father, through the Son and in the Holy Spirit, 
pouring out his heavenly gifts on all things without exception. Thanks to his mercy, we too, 
men that we are, have received the inalienable promise of eternal life.— 


IN BRIEF 

1051 Every man receives his eternal recompense in his immortal soul from the moment of his death 
in a particular judgment by Christ, the judge of the living and the dead. 

1052 “We believe that the souls of all who die in Christ’s grace... are the People of God beyond 
death. On the day of resurrection, death will be definitively conquered, when these souls will be 
reunited with their bodies” (Paul VI, CPG § 28). 

1053 “We believe that the multitude of those gathered around Jesus and Mary in Paradise forms the 
Church of heaven, where in eternal blessedness they see God as he is and where they are also, to 
various degrees, associated with the holy angels in the divine governance exercised by Christ in 
glory, by interceding for us and helping our weakness by their fraternal concern” (Paul VI, CPG § 
29). 

1054 Those who die in God’s grace and friendship imperfectly purified, although they are assured 
of their eternal salvation, undergo a purification after death, so as to achieve the holiness necessary 
to enter the joy of God. 

1055 By virtue of the “communion of saints,” the Church commends the dead to God’s mercy and 
offers her prayers, especially the holy sacrifice of the Eucharist, on their behalf. 







1056 Following the example of Christ, the Church warns the faithful of the “sad and lamentable 
reality of eternal death” (GCD 69), also called “hell.” 

1057 Hell’s principal punishment consists of eternal separation from God in whom alone man can 
have the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs. 

1058 The Church prays that no one should be lost: “Lord, let me never be parted from you.” If it is 
true that no one can save himself, it is also true that God “desires all men to be saved” (1 Tim 2:4), 
and that for him “all things are possible” (Mf 19:26). 

1059 “The holy Roman Church firmly believes and confesses that on the Day of Judgment all men 
will appear in their own bodies before Christ’s tribunal to render an account of their own deeds” 
(Council of Lyons II [1274]: DS 859; cf. DS 1549). 

1060 At the end of time, the Kingdom of God will come in its fullness. Then the just will reign with 
Christ for ever, glorified in body and soul, and the material universe itself will be transformed. God 
will then be “all in all” (1 Cor 15:28), in eternal life. 


“Amen” 


1061 The Creed, like the last book of the Bible, §46 ends with the Hebrew word amen. This word 
frequently concludes prayers in the New Testament. The Church likewise ends her prayers with 
“Amen.” 1 2856 ] 

1062 In Hebrew, amen comes from the same root as the word “believe.” This root expresses 
solidity, trustworthiness, faithfulness. And so we can understand why “Amen” may express both 
God’s faithfulness towards us and our trust in him. 1 214 ] 

1063 In the book of the prophet Isaiah, we find the expression “God of truth” (literally “God of the 
Amen”), that is, the God who is faithful to his promises: “He who blesses himself in the land shall 
bless himself by the God of truth [amen].”§4Z Our Lord often used the word “Amen,” sometimes 
repeated,^ to emphasize the trustworthiness of his teaching, his authority founded on God’s truth. 
(215, 156 ] 

1064 Thus the Creed’s final “Amen” repeats and confirms its first words: “I believe.” To believe is 
to say “Amen” to God’s words, promises and commandments; to entrust oneself completely to him 











who is the “Amen” of infinite love and perfect faithfulness. The Christian’s everyday life will then 
be the “Amen” to the “I believe” of our baptismal profession of faith: ( 197 . 2101 1 


May your Creed be for you as a mirror. Look at yourself in it, to see if you believe everything 
you say you believe. And rejoice in your faith each day. §42 

1065 Jesus Christ himself is the “Amen.”§§2 He is the definitive “Amen” of the Father’s love for 
us. He takes up and completes our “Amen” to the Father: “For all the promises of God find their 
Yes in him. That is why we utter the Amen through him, to the glory of God”:§§i 

Through him, with him, in him, 
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, 
all glory and honor is yours, 
almighty Father, 

God, for ever and ever. 

AMEN.

PART TWO 

THE CELEBRATION OF THE CHRISTIAN 

MYSTERY 


Why the liturgy? 

1066 In the Symbol of the faith the Church confesses the mystery of the Holy Trinity and of the 
plan of God’s “good pleasure” for all creation: the Father accomplishes the “mystery of his will” by 
giving his beloved Son and his Holy Spirit for the salvation of the world and for the glory of his 
name i Such is the mystery of Christ, revealed and fulfilled in history according to the wisely 
ordered plan that St. Paul calls the “plan of the mystery”^ and the patristic tradition will call the 
“economy of the Word incarnate” or the “economy of salvation.” 

1067 “The wonderful works of God among the people of the Old Testament were but a prelude to 
the work of Christ the Lord in redeeming mankind and giving perfect glory to God. He 
accomplished this work principally by the Paschal mystery of his blessed Passion, Resurrection 
from the dead, and glorious Ascension, whereby ‘dying he destroyed our death, rising he restored 
our life.’ For it was from the side of Christ as he slept the sleep of death upon the cross that there 
came forth ‘the wondrous sacrament of the whole Church. ’”2 For this reason, the Church celebrates 
in the liturgy above all the Paschal mystery by which Christ accomplished the work of our 
salvation. 

1068 It is this mystery of Christ that the Church proclaims and celebrates in her liturgy so that the 
faithful may live from it and bear witness to it in the world: 

For it is in the liturgy, especially in the divine sacrifice of the Eucharist, that “the work of our 
redemption is accomplished,” and it is through the liturgy especially that the faithful are 
enabled to express in their lives and manifest to others the mystery of Christ and the real 
nature of the true Church.^ 

What does the word liturgy mean? 

1069 The word “liturgy” originally meant a “public work” or a “service in the name of/on behalf of 
the people.” In Christian tradition it means the participation of the People of God in “the work of 


God.”^ Through the liturgy Christ, our redeemer and high priest, continues the work of our 
redemption in, with, and through his Church. 

1070 In the New Testament the word “liturgy” refers not only to the celebration of divine worship 
but also to the proclamation of the Gospel and to active charity.^ In all of these situations it is a 
question of the service of God and neighbor. In a liturgical celebration the Church is servant in the 
image of her Lord, the one “ leitourgos ”;2 she shares in Christ’s priesthood (worship), which is both 
prophetic (proclamation) and kingly (service of charity): 

The liturgy then is rightly seen as an exercise of the priestly office of Jesus Christ. It involves 
the presentation of man’s sanctification under the guise of signs perceptible by the senses and 
its accomplishment in ways appropriate to each of these signs. In it full public worship is 
performed by the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, that is, by the Head and his members. From 
this it follows that every liturgical celebration, because it is an action of Christ the priest and 
of his Body which is the Church, is a sacred action surpassing all others. No other action of the 
Church can equal its efficacy by the same title and to the same degree. ^ 

Liturgy as source of life 

1071 As the work of Christ liturgy is also an action of his Church. It makes the Church present and 
manifests her as the visible sign of the communion in Christ between God and men. It engages the 
faithful in the new life of the community and involves the “conscious, active, and fruitful 
participation” of everyone 

1072 “The sacred liturgy does not exhaust the entire activity of the Church”;! - it must be preceded 
by evangelization, faith, and conversion. It can then produce its fruits in the lives of the faithful: 
new life in the Spirit, involvement in the mission of the Church, and service to her unity. 

Prayer and liturgy 

1073 The liturgy is also a participation in Christ’s own prayer addressed to the Father in the Holy 
Spirit. In the liturgy, all Christian prayer finds its source and goal. Through the liturgy the inner 
man is rooted and grounded in “the great love with which [the Father] loved us” in his beloved 
Son.H It is the same “marvelous work of God” that is lived and internalized by all prayer, “at all 
times in the Spirit.”^ 


Catechesis and liturgy 


1074 “The liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is directed; it is also the 
font from which all her power flows. ”13 It is therefore the privileged place for catechizing the 
People of God. “Catechesis is intrinsically linked with the whole of liturgical and sacramental 
activity, for it is in the sacraments, especially in the Eucharist, that Christ Jesus works in fullness 
for the transformation of men.”14 

1075 Liturgical catechesis aims to initiate people into the mystery of Christ (It is “mystagogy.”) by 
proceeding from the visible to the invisible, from the sign to the thing signified, from the 
“sacraments” to the “mysteries.” Such catechesis is to be presented by local and regional 
catechisms. This Catechism, which aims to serve the whole Church in all the diversity of her rites 
and cultures, 12 will present what is fundamental and common to the whole Church in the liturgy as 
mystery and as celebration (Section One), and then the seven sacraments and the sacramentals 
(Section Two).

SECTION ONE 

THE SACRAMENTAL ECONOMY 


1076 The Church was made manifest to the world on the day of Pentecost by the outpouring of the 
Holy Spirit.i The gift of the Spirit ushers in a new era in the “dispensation of the mystery” — the 
age of the Church, during which Christ manifests, makes present, and communicates his work of 
salvation through the liturgy of his Church, “until he comes.In this age of the Church Christ now 
lives and acts in and with his Church, in a new way appropriate to this new age. He acts through the 
sacraments in what the common Tradition of the East and the West calls “the sacramental 
economy”; this is the communication (or “dispensation”) of the fruits of Christ’s Paschal mystery 
in the celebration of the Church’s “sacramental” liturgy. (739) 

It is therefore important first to explain this “sacramental dispensation” ( chapter one ). The 
nature and essential features of liturgical celebration will then appear more clearly (chapter two ). 





CHAPTER ONE 

THE PASCHAL MYSTERY IN THE AGE OF THE CHURCH 


ARTICLE 1 

THE LITURGY—WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY 
I. The Father—Source and Goal of the Liturgy 

1077 “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with 
every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of 
the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. He destined us before him in love to 
be his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious 
grace which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.”^ (492) 

1078 Blessing is a divine and life-giving action, the source of which is the Father; his blessing is 
both word and gift .4 When applied to man, the word “blessing” means adoration and surrender to 
his Creator in thanksgiving. (2626) 

1079 From the beginning until the end of time the whole of God’s work is a blessing. From the 
liturgical poem of the first creation to the canticles of the heavenly Jerusalem, the inspired authors 
proclaim the plan of salvation as one vast divine blessing. 

1080 From the very beginning God blessed all living beings, especially man and woman. The 
covenant with Noah and with all living things renewed this blessing of fruitfulness despite man’s 
sin which had brought a curse on the ground. But with Abraham, the divine blessing entered into 
human history which was moving toward death, to redirect it toward life, toward its source. By the 
faith of “the father of all believers,” who embraced the blessing, the history of salvation is 
inaugurated. 

1081 The divine blessings were made manifest in astonishing and saving events: the birth of Isaac, 
the escape from Egypt (Passover and Exodus), the gift of the promised land, the election of David, 
the presence of God in the Temple, the purifying exile, and return of a “small remnant.” The Law, 
the Prophets, and the Psalms, interwoven in the liturgy of the Chosen People, recall these divine 
blessings and at the same time respond to them with blessings of praise and thanksgiving. 

1082 In the Church’s liturgy the divine blessing is fully revealed and communicated. The Father is 




acknowledged and adored as the source and the end of all the blessings of creation and salvation. In 
his Word who became incarnate, died, and rose for us, he fills us with his blessings. Through his 
Word, he pours into our hearts the Gift that contains all gifts, the Holy Spirit. 

1083 The dual dimension of the Christian liturgy as a response of faith and love to the spiritual 
blessings the Father bestows on us is thus evident. On the one hand, the Church, united with her 
Lord and “in the Holy Spirit,”^ blesses the Father “for his inexpressible gift”§ in her adoration, 
praise, and thanksgiving. On the other hand, until the consummation of God’s plan, the Church 
never ceases to present to the Father the offering of his own gifts and to beg him to send the Holy 
Spirit upon that offering, upon herself, upon the faithful, and upon the whole world, so that through 
communion in the death and resurrection of Christ the Priest, and by the power of the Spirit, these 
divine blessings will bring forth the fruits of life “to the praise of his glorious grace. 1 2627 . 1360 1 

II. Christ’s Work in the Liturgy 

Christ glorified... 

1084 “Seated at the right hand of the Father” and pouring out the Holy Spirit on his Body which is 
the Church, Christ now acts through the sacraments he instituted to communicate his grace. The 
sacraments are perceptible signs (words and actions) accessible to our human nature. By the action 
of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit they make present efficaciously the grace that they 
signify. (662, 1127 1 

1085 In the liturgy of the Church, it is principally his own Paschal mystery that Christ signifies and 
makes present. During his earthly life Jesus announced his Paschal mystery by his teaching and 
anticipated it by his actions. When his Hour comes, he lives out the unique event of history which 
does not pass away: Jesus dies, is buried, rises from the dead, and is seated at the right hand of the 
Father “once for all.”§ His Paschal mystery is a real event that occurred in our history, but it is 
unique: all other historical events happen once, and then they pass away, swallowed up in the past. 
The Paschal mystery of Christ, by contrast, cannot remain only in the past, because by his death he 
destroyed death, and all that Christ is—all that he did and suffered for all men—participates in the 
divine eternity, and so transcends all times while being made present in them all. The event of the 
Cross and Resurrection abides and draws everything toward life. (519, 1165 1 

...from the time of the Church of the Apostles... 


1086 “Accordingly, just as Christ was sent by the Father so also he sent the apostles, filled with the 








Holy Spirit. This he did so that they might preach the Gospel to every creature and proclaim that 
the Son of God by his death and resurrection had freed us from the power of Satan and from death 
and brought us into the Kingdom of his Father. But he also willed that the work of salvation which 
they preached should be set in train through the sacrifice and sacraments, around which the entire 
liturgical life revolves. ”2 (858) 

1087 Thus the risen Christ, by giving the Holy Spirit to the apostles, entrusted to them his power of 
sanctifying: 12 they became sacramental signs of Christ. By the power of the same Holy Spirit they 
entrusted this power to their successors. This “apostolic succession” structures the whole liturgical 
life of the Church and is itself sacramental, handed on by the sacrament of Holy Orders. (861, 
1536) 

...is present in the earthly liturgy... 

1088 “To accomplish so great a work” — the dispensation or communication of his work of 
salvation — “Christ is always present in his Church, especially in her liturgical celebrations. He is 
present in the Sacrifice of the Mass not only in the person of his minister, The same now offering, 
through the ministry of priests, who formerly offered himself on the cross,’ but especially in the 
Eucharistic species. By his power he is present in the sacraments so that when anybody baptizes, it 
is really Christ himself who baptizes. He is present in his word since it is he himself who speaks 
when the holy Scriptures are read in the Church. Lastly, he is present when the Church prays and 
sings, for he has promised ‘where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the 
midst of them.’”!± (776, 669, 1373) 

1089 “Christ, indeed, always associates the Church with himself in this great work in which God is 
perfectly glorified and men are sanctified. The Church is his beloved Bride who calls to her Lord 
and through him offers worship to the eternal Father.”!^ (796) 

...which participates in the liturgy of heaven 

1090 “In the earthly liturgy we share in a foretaste of that heavenly liturgy which is celebrated in 
the Holy City of Jerusalem toward which we journey as pilgrims, where Christ is sitting at the right 
hand of God, Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle. With all the warriors of the 
heavenly army we sing a hymn of glory to the Lord; venerating the memory of the saints, we hope 
for some part and fellowship with them; we eagerly await the Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, until 
he, our life, shall appear and we too will appear with him in glory. ”12 ( 1137-1139 1 










III. The Holy Spirit and the Church in the Liturgy 


1091 In the liturgy the Holy Spirit is teacher of the faith of the People of God and artisan of “God’s 
masterpieces,” the sacraments of the New Covenant. The desire and work of the Spirit in the heart 
of the Church is that we may live from the life of the risen Christ. When the Spirit encounters in us 
the response of faith which he has aroused in us, he brings about genuine cooperation. Through it, 
the liturgy becomes the common work of the Holy Spirit and the Church. 1 798 1 

1092 In this sacramental dispensation of Christ’s mystery the Holy Spirit acts in the same way as at 
other times in the economy of salvation: he prepares the Church to encounter her Lord; he recalls 
and makes Christ manifest to the faith of the assembly. By his transforming power, he makes the 
mystery of Christ present here and now. Finally the Spirit of communion unites the Church to the 
life and mission of Christ. ( 7 37 1 

The Holy Spirit prepares for the reception of Christ 

1093 In the sacramental economy the Holy Spirit fulfills what was prefigured in the Old Covenant. 
Since Christ’s Church was “prepared in marvellous fashion in the history of the people of Israel and 
in the Old Covenant, ”14 the Church’s liturgy has retained certain elements of the worship of the 
Old Covenant as integral and irreplaceable, adopting them as her own: (Z62, 121 . 2585 . 1081 1 

-notably, reading the Old Testament; 

-praying the Psalms; 

-above all, recalling the saving events and significant realities which have found their 
fulfillment in the mystery of Christ (promise and covenant, Exodus and Passover, kingdom 
and temple, exile and return). 

1094 It is on this harmony of the two Testaments that the Paschal catechesis of the Lord is built, 15 
and then, that of the Apostles and the Fathers of the Church. This catechesis unveils what lay 
hidden under the letter of the Old Testament: the mystery of Christ. It is called “typological” 
because it reveals the newness of Christ on the basis of the “figures” (types) which announce him 
in the deeds, words, and symbols of the first covenant. By this re-reading in the Spirit of Truth, 
starting from Christ, the figures are unveiled.15 Thus the flood and Noah’s ark prefigured salvation 
by Baptism, H as did the cloud and the crossing of the Red Sea. Water from the rock was the figure 
of the spiritual gifts of Christ, and manna in the desert prefigured the Eucharist, “the true bread 
from heaven.”l£ 1128-130 1 









1095 For this reason the Church, especially during Advent and Lent and above all at the Easter 
Vigil, re-reads and re-lives the great events of salvation history in the “today” of her liturgy. But 
this also demands that catechesis help the faithful to open themselves to this spiritual understanding 
of the economy of salvation as the Church’s liturgy reveals it and enables us to live it. (281, 111) 

1096 Jewish liturgy and Christian liturgy. A better knowledge of the Jewish people’s faith and 
religious life as professed and lived even now can help our better understanding of certain aspects 
of Christian liturgy. For both Jews and Christians Sacred Scripture is an essential part of their 
respective liturgies: in the proclamation of the Word of God, the response to this word, prayer of 
praise and intercession for the living and the dead, invocation of God’s mercy. In its characteristic 
structure the Liturgy of the Word originates in Jewish prayer. The Liturgy of the Hours and other 
liturgical texts and formularies, as well as those of our most venerable prayers, including the Lord’s 
Prayer, have parallels in Jewish prayer. The Eucharistic Prayers also draw their inspiration from the 
Jewish tradition. The relationship between Jewish liturgy and Christian liturgy, but also their 
differences in content, are particularly evident in the great feasts of the liturgical year, such as 
Passover. Christians and Jews both celebrate the Passover. For Jews, it is the Passover of history, 
tending toward the future; for Christians, it is the Passover fulfilled in the death and Resurrection of 
Christ, though always in expectation of its definitive consummation. (1174, 1352 . 840 1 

1097 In the liturgy of the New Covenant every liturgical action, especially the celebration of the 
Eucharist and the sacraments, is an encounter between Christ and the Church. The liturgical 
assembly derives its unity from the “communion of the Holy Spirit” who gathers the children of 
God into the one Body of Christ. This assembly transcends racial, cultural, social—indeed, all 
human affinities. 

1098 The assembly should prepare itself to encounter its Lord and to become “a people well 
disposed.” The preparation of hearts is the joint work of the Holy Spirit and the assembly, 
especially of its ministers. The grace of the Holy Spirit seeks to awaken faith, conversion of heart, 
and adherence to the Father’s will. These dispositions are the precondition both for the reception of 
other graces conferred in the celebration itself and the fruits of new life which the celebration is 
intended to produce afterward. ( 1430 ) 

The Holy Spirit recalls the mystery of Christ 

1099 The Spirit and the Church cooperate to manifest Christ and his work of salvation in the 
liturgy. Primarily in the Eucharist, and by analogy in the other sacraments, the liturgy is the 








memorial of the mystery of salvation. The Holy Spirit is the Church’s living memory.^ (91) 

1100 The Word of God. The Holy Spirit first recalls the meaning of the salvation event to the 
liturgical assembly by giving life to the Word of God, which is proclaimed so that it may be 
received and lived: ( 1134 . 103 . 131 ) 

In the celebration of the liturgy, Sacred Scripture is extremely important. From it come the 
lessons that are read and explained in the homily and the psalms that are sung. It is from the 
Scriptures that the prayers, collects, and hymns draw their inspiration and their force, and that 
actions and signs derive their meaning.^ 

1101 The Holy Spirit gives a spiritual understanding of the Word of God to those who read or hear 
it, according to the dispositions of their hearts. By means of the words, actions, and symbols that 
form the structure of a celebration, the Spirit puts both the faithful and the ministers into a living 
relationship with Christ, the Word and Image of the Father, so that they can live out the meaning of 
what they hear, contemplate, and do in the celebration. ( 117 ) 

1102 “By the saving word of God, faith... is nourished in the hearts of believers. By this faith then 
the congregation of the faithful begins and grows.The proclamation does not stop with a 
teaching; it elicits the response of faith as consent and commitment, directed at the covenant 
between God and his people. Once again it is the Holy Spirit who gives the grace of faith, 
strengthens it and makes it grow in the community. The liturgical assembly is first of all a 
communion in faith. ( 143 ) 

1103 Anamnesis. The liturgical celebration always refers to God’s saving interventions in history. 
“The economy of Revelation is realized by deeds and words which are intrinsically bound up with 
each other.... [T]he words for their part proclaim the works and bring to light the mystery they 
contain.”^ In the Liturgy of the Word the Holy Spirit “recalls” to the assembly all that Christ has 
done for us. In keeping with the nature of liturgical actions and the ritual traditions of the churches, 
the celebration “makes a remembrance” of the marvelous works of God in an anamnesis which may 
be more or less developed. The Holy Spirit who thus awakens the memory of the Church then 
inspires thanksgiving and praise ( doxology ). (1362) 

The Holy Spirit makes present the mystery of Christ 

1104 Christian liturgy not only recalls the events that saved us but actualizes them, makes them 
present. The Paschal mystery of Christ is celebrated, not repeated. It is the celebrations that are 








repeated, and in each celebration there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit that makes the unique 
mystery present. (1085) 

1105 The Epiclesis (“invocation upon”) is the intercession in which the priest begs the Father to 
send the Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier, so that the offerings may become the body and blood of Christ 
and that the faithful, by receiving them, may themselves become a living offering to God.^ (1153) 

1106 Together with the anamnesis, the epiclesis is at the heart of each sacramental celebration, 
most especially of the Eucharist: ( 1375 ) 

You ask how the bread becomes the Body of Christ, and the wine... the Blood of Christ. I shall 
tell you: the Holy Spirit comes upon them and accomplishes what surpasses every word and 
thought.... Let it be enough for you to understand that it is by the Holy Spirit, just as it was of 
the Holy Virgin and by the Holy Spirit that the Lord, through and in himself, took flesh.24 

1107 The Holy Spirit’s transforming power in the liturgy hastens the coming of the kingdom and 
the consummation of the mystery of salvation. While we wait in hope he causes us really to 
anticipate the fullness of communion with the Holy Trinity. Sent by the Lather who hears the 
epiclesis of the Church, the Spirit gives life to those who accept him and is, even now, the 
“guarantee” of their inheritance.^ ( 2816 ) 

The communion of the Holy Spirit 

1108 In every liturgical action the Holy Spirit is sent in order to bring us into communion with 
Christ and so to form his Body. The Holy Spirit is like the sap of the Father’s vine which bears fruit 
on its branches.^ The most intimate cooperation of the Holy Spirit and the Church is achieved in 
the liturgy. The Spirit, who is the Spirit of communion, abides indefectibly in the Church. For this 
reason the Church is the great sacrament of divine communion which gathers God’s scattered 
children together. Communion with the Holy Trinity and fraternal communion are inseparably the 
fruit of the Spirit in the liturgy.^ 7 ( 788 . 1091 . 775 ) 

1109 The epiclesis is also a prayer for the full effect of the assembly’s communion with the 
mystery of Christ. “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of 
the Holy Spirit”^ have to remain with us always and bear fruit beyond the Eucharistic celebration. 
The Church therefore asks the Lather to send the Holy Spirit to make the lives of the faithful a 
living sacrifice to God by their spiritual transformation into the image of Christ, by concern for the 
Church’s unity, and by taking part in her mission through the witness and service of charity. (1368) 










IN BRIEF 

1110 In the liturgy of the Church, God the Father is blessed and adored as the source of all the 
blessings of creation and salvation with which he has blessed us in his Son, in order to give us the 
Spirit of filial adoption. 

1111 Christ’s work in the liturgy is sacramental: because his mystery of salvation is made present 
there by the power of his Holy Spirit; because his Body, which is the Church, is like a sacrament 
(sign and instrument) in which the Holy Spirit dispenses the mystery of salvation; and because 
through her liturgical actions the pilgrim Church already participates, as by a foretaste, in the 
heavenly liturgy. 

1112 The mission of the Holy Spirit in the liturgy of the Church is to prepare the assembly to 
encounter Christ; to recall and manifest Christ to the faith of the assembly; to make the saving work 
of Christ present and active by his transforming power; and to make the gift of communion bear 
fruit in the Church. 


ARTICLE 2 

THE PASCHAL MYSTERY IN THE CHURCH’S SACRAMENTS 


1113 The whole liturgical life of the Church revolves around the Eucharistic sacrifice and the 
sacraments.29 There are seven sacraments in the Church: Baptism, Confirmation or Chrismation, 
Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.^ This article will discuss 
what is common to the Church’s seven sacraments from a doctrinal point of view. What is common 
to them in terms of their celebration will be presented in the second chapter, and what is distinctive 
about each will be the topic of Section Two. ( 1210 1 

I. The Sacraments of Christ 

1114 “Adhering to the teaching of the Holy Scriptures, to the apostolic traditions, and to the 
consensus... of the Fathers,” we profess that “the sacraments of the new law were... all instituted by 
Jesus Christ our Lord.”^i 

1115 Jesus’ words and actions during his hidden life and public ministry were already salvific, for 
they anticipated the power of his Paschal mystery. They announced and prepared what he was 











going to give the Church when all was accomplished. The mysteries of Christ’s life are the 
foundations of what he would henceforth dispense in the sacraments, through the ministers of his 
Church, for “what was visible in our Savior has passed over into his mysteries.”^ ( 512-560 1 

1116 Sacraments are “powers that comes forth” from the Body of Christ,^ which is ever-living and 
life-giving. They are actions of the Holy Spirit at work in his Body, the Church. They are “the 
masterworks of God” in the new and everlasting covenant. ( 1504 . 774 1 

II. The Sacraments of the Church 

1117 As she has done for the canon of Sacred Scripture and for the doctrine of the faith, the 
Church, by the power of the Spirit who guides her “into all truth,” has gradually recognized this 
treasure received from Christ and, as the faithful steward of God’s mysteries, has determined its 
“dispensation.”^ Thus the Church has discerned over the centuries that among liturgical 
celebrations there are seven that are, in the strict sense of the term, sacraments instituted by the 
Lord. ( 120 1 

1118 The sacraments are “of the Church” in the double sense that they are “by her” and “for her.” 
They are “by the Church,” for she is the sacrament of Christ’s action at work in her through the 
mission of the Holy Spirit. They are “for the Church” in the sense that “the sacraments make the 
Church,”^ since they manifest and communicate to men, above all in the Eucharist, the mystery of 
communion with the God who is love, One in three persons. ( 1396 1 

1119 Forming “as it were, one mystical person” with Christ the head, the Church acts in the 
sacraments as “an organically structured priestly community.”^ Through Baptism and 
Confirmation the priestly people is enabled to celebrate the liturgy, while those of the faithful “who 
have received Holy Orders, are appointed to nourish the Church with the word and grace of God in 
the name of Christ.”^ (792) 

1120 The ordained ministry or ministerial priesthood is at the service of the baptismal priesthood.^ 
The ordained priesthood guarantees that it really is Christ who acts in the sacraments through the 
Holy Spirit for the Church. The saving mission entrusted by the Father to his incarnate Son was 
committed to the apostles and through them to their successors: they receive the Spirit of Jesus to 
act in his name and in his person.^ The ordained minister is the sacramental bond that ties the 
liturgical action to what the apostles said and did and, through them, to the words and actions of 
Christ, the source and foundation of the sacraments. ( 1547 1 









1121 The three sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders confer, in addition to grace, 
a sacramental character or “seal” by which the Christian shares in Christ’s priesthood and is made 
a member of the Church according to different states and functions. This configuration to Christ 
and to the Church, brought about by the Spirit, is indelible;^ it remains for ever in the Christian as 
a positive disposition for grace, a promise and guarantee of divine protection, and as a vocation to 
divine worship and to the service of the Church. Therefore these sacraments can never be repeated. 
1 1272 . 1304 . 1582) 

III. The Sacraments of Faith 

1122 Christ sent his apostles so that “repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his 
name to all nations.”^ “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name 
of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”^ The mission to baptize, and so the 
sacramental mission, is implied in the mission to evangelize, because the sacrament is prepared for 
by the word of God and by the faith which is assent to this word: ( 849 . 1236 1 

The People of God is formed into one in the first place by the Word of the living God.... The 
preaching of the Word is required for the sacramental ministry itself, since the sacraments are 
sacraments of faith, drawing their origin and nourishment from the Word.42 

1123 “The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify men, to build up the Body of Christ and, finally, 
to give worship to God. Because they are signs they also instruct. They not only presuppose faith, 
but by words and objects they also nourish, strengthen, and express it. That is why they are called 
‘sacraments of faith.’ ”44 ( 1154 ) 

1124 The Church’s faith precedes the faith of the believer who is invited to adhere to it. When the 
Church celebrates the sacraments, she confesses the faith received from the apostles—whence the 
ancient saying: lex orandi, lex credendi (or: legem credendi lex statuat supplicandi, according to 
Prosper of Aquitaine [5th cent.]).^ The law of prayer is the law of faith: the Church believes as she 
prays. Liturgy is a constitutive element of the holy and living Tradition.^ (166, 1327 . 78) 

1125 For this reason no sacramental rite may be modified or manipulated at the will of the minister 
or the community. Even the supreme authority in the Church may not change the liturgy arbitrarily, 
but only in the obedience of faith and with religious respect for the mystery of the liturgy. ( 1205 ) 

1126 Likewise, since the sacraments express and develop the communion of faith in the Church, 
the lex orandi is one of the essential criteria of the dialogue that seeks to restore the unity of 











Christians.^? ( 815 ^ 

IV. The Sacraments of Salvation 


1127 Celebrated worthily in faith, the sacraments confer the grace that they signify.They are 
efficacious because in them Christ himself is at work: it is he who baptizes, he who acts in his 
sacraments in order to communicate the grace that each sacrament signifies. The Father always 
hears the prayer of his Son’s Church which, in the epiclesis of each sacrament, expresses her faith 
in the power of the Spirit. As fire transforms into itself everything it touches, so the Holy Spirit 
transforms into the divine life whatever is subjected to his power. 1 1084 . 1105 . 696) 

1128 This is the meaning of the Church’s affirmation^ that the sacraments act ex opere operato 
(literally: “by the very fact of the action’s being performed”), i.e., by virtue of the saving work of 
Christ, accomplished once for all. It follows that “the sacrament is not wrought by the 
righteousness of either the celebrant or the recipient, but by the power of God.”^ From the moment 
that a sacrament is celebrated in accordance with the intention of the Church, the power of Christ 
and his Spirit acts in and through it, independently of the personal holiness of the minister. 
Nevertheless, the fruits of the sacraments also depend on the disposition of the one who receives 
them. ( 1584 ) 

1129 The Church affirms that for believers the sacraments of the New Covenant are necessary for 
salvation “Sacramental grace” is the grace of the Holy Spirit, given by Christ and proper to each 
sacrament. The Spirit heals and transforms those who receive him by conforming them to the Son 
of God. The fruit of the sacramental life is that the Spirit of adoption makes the faithful partakers in 
the divine nature^ by uniting them in a living union with the only Son, the Savior. ( 1257 . 2003 . 
460) 

V. The Sacraments of Eternal Life 

1130 The Church celebrates the mystery of her Lord “until he comes,” when God will be 
“everything to everyone.”^ Since the apostolic age the liturgy has been drawn toward its goal by 
the Spirit’s groaning in the Church: Marana tha'M The liturgy thus shares in Jesus’ desire: “I have 
earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you... until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”^ In the 
sacraments of Christ the Church already receives the guarantee of her inheritance and even now 
shares in everlasting life, while “awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great 
God and Savior Christ Jesus. The “Spirit and the Bride say, ‘Come... Come, Lord Jesus!”’??? 










(2817, 950) 


St. Thomas sums up the various aspects of sacramental signs: “Therefore a sacrament is a sign 
that commemorates what precedes it—Christ’s Passion; demonstrates what is accomplished in 
us through Christ’s Passion—grace; and prefigures what that Passion pledges to us—future 
glory. 


IN BRIEF 

1131 The sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the 
Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. The visible rites by which the sacraments are 
celebrated signify and make present the graces proper to each sacrament. They bear fruit in those 
who receive them with the required dispositions. 

1132 The Church celebrates the sacraments as a priestly community structured by the baptismal 
priesthood and the priesthood of ordained ministers. 

1133 The Holy Spirit prepares the faithful for the sacraments by the Word of God and the faith 
which welcomes that word in well-disposed hearts. Thus the sacraments strengthen faith and 
express it. 

1134 The fruit of sacramental life is both personal and ecclesial. For every one of the faithful on the 
one hand, this fruit is life for God in Christ Jesus; for the Church, on the other, it is an increase in 
charity and in her mission of witness.

CHAPTER TWO 

THE SACRAMENTAL CELEBRATION OF THE PASCHAL 

MYSTERY 


1135 The catechesis of the liturgy entails first of all an understanding of the sacramental economy 
(Chapter One). In this light, the innovation of its celebration is revealed. This chapter will therefore 
treat of the celebration of the sacraments of the Church. It will consider that which, through the 
diversity of liturgical traditions, is common to the celebration of the seven sacraments. What is 
proper to each will be treated later. This fundamental catechesis on the sacramental celebrations 
responds to the first questions posed by the faithful regarding this subject: 

—Who celebrates the liturgy? 

—How is the liturgy celebrated? 

—When is the liturgy celebrated? 

—Where is the liturgy celebrated? 

ARTICLE 1 

CELEBRATING THE CHURCH’S LITURGY 


I. Who Celebrates? 

1136 Liturgy is an “action” of the whole Christ (Christus totus). Those who even now celebrate it 
without signs are already in the heavenly liturgy, where celebration is wholly communion and feast. 
1 795 . 1090 1 

The celebrants of the heavenly liturgy 2642 

1137 The book of Revelation of St. John, read in the Church’s liturgy, first reveals to us, “A throne 
stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne”: “the Lord God.”! It then shows the Lamb, 
“standing, as though it had been slain”: Christ crucified and risen, the one high priest of the true 
sanctuary, the same one “who offers and is offered, who gives and is given.”2 Finally it presents 
“the river of the water of life... flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,” one of most 
beautiful symbols of the Holy Spirit.^ 1 662 1 


1138 “Recapitulated in Christ,” these are the ones who take part in the service of the praise of God 








and the fulfillment of his plan: the heavenly powers, all creation (the four living beings), the 
servants of the Old and New Covenants (the twenty-four elders), the new People of God (the one 
hundred and forty-four thousand), 4 especially the martyrs “slain for the word of God,” and the all¬ 
holy Mother of God (the Woman), the Bride of the Lamb,^ and finally “a great multitude which no 
one could number, from every nation, from all tribes, and peoples and tongues. (335, 1370 ) 

1139 It is in this eternal liturgy that the Spirit and the Church enable us to participate whenever we 
celebrate the mystery of salvation in the sacraments. 

The celebrants of the sacramental liturgy 

1140 It is the whole community, the Body of Christ united with its Head, that celebrates. “Liturgical 
services are not private functions but are celebrations of the Church which is ‘the sacrament of 
unity,’ namely, the holy people united and organized under the authority of the bishops. Therefore, 
liturgical services pertain to the whole Body of the Church. They manifest it, and have effects upon 
it. But they touch individual members of the Church in different ways, depending on their orders, 
their role in the liturgical services, and their actual participation in them.”! For this reason, “rites 
which are meant to be celebrated in common, with the faithful present and actively participating, 
should as far as possible be celebrated in that way rather than by an individual and quasi- 
privately.”^ (752, 1348, 1372 ) 

1141 The celebrating assembly is the community of the baptized who, “by regeneration and the 
anointing of the Holy Spirit, are consecrated to be a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, that 
through all the works of Christian men they may offer spiritual sacrifices. ”2 This “common 
priesthood” is that of Christ the sole priest, in which all his members participate ;12 ( 1120 . 1268 ) 

Mother Church earnestly desires that all the faithful should be led to that full, conscious, and 
active participation in liturgical celebrations which is demanded by the very nature of the 
liturgy, and to which the Christian people, “a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a 
redeemed people,” have a right and an obligation by reason of their Baptism.il 

1142 But “the members do not all have the same function.”12 Certain members are called by God, 
in and through the Church, to a special service of the community. These servants are chosen and 
consecrated by the sacrament of Holy Orders, by which the Holy Spirit enables them to act in the 
person of Christ the head, for the service of all the members of the Church.13 The ordained minister 
is, as it were, an “icon” of Christ the priest. Since it is in the Eucharist that the sacrament of the 
Church is made fully visible, it is in his presiding at the Eucharist that the bishop’s ministry is most 









evident, as well as, in communion with him, the ministry of priests and deacons. ( 1549 . 1561 1 


1143 For the purpose of assisting the work of the common priesthood of the faithful, other 
particular ministries also exist, not consecrated by the sacrament of Holy Orders; their functions 
are determined by the bishops, in accord with liturgical traditions and pastoral needs. “Servers, 
readers, commentators, and members of the choir also exercise a genuine liturgical function. ”14 
( 903 . 1672 1 

1144 In the celebration of the sacraments it is thus the whole assembly that is leitourgos, each 
according to his function, but in the “unity of the Spirit” who acts in all. “In liturgical celebrations 
each person, minister or layman, who has an office to perform, should carry out all and only those 
parts which pertain to his office by the nature of the rite and the norms of the liturgy.”^ 

II. How Is the Liturgy Celebrated? 

Signs and symbols 1333-1340 

1145 A sacramental celebration is woven from signs and symbols. In keeping with the divine 
pedagogy of salvation, their meaning is rooted in the work of creation and in human culture, 
specified by the events of the Old Covenant and fully revealed in the person and work of Christ. 
(53) 

1146 Signs of the human world. In human life, signs and symbols occupy an important place. As a 
being at once body and spirit, man expresses and perceives spiritual realities through physical signs 
and symbols. As a social being, man needs signs and symbols to communicate with others, through 
language, gestures, and actions. The same holds true for his relationship with God. (362, 2702 . 
1879 1 

1147 God speaks to man through the visible creation. The material cosmos is so presented to man’s 
intelligence that he can read there traces of its Creator.lh Light and darkness, wind and fire, water 
and earth, the tree and its fruit speak of God and symbolize both his greatness and his nearness. 
(299) 

1148 Inasmuch as they are creatures, these perceptible realities can become means of expressing 
the action of God who sanctifies men, and the action of men who offer worship to God. The same 
is true of signs and symbols taken from the social life of man: washing and anointing, breaking 
bread and sharing the cup can express the sanctifying presence of God and man’s gratitude toward 











his Creator. 


1149 The great religions of mankind witness, often impressively, to this cosmic and symbolic 
meaning of religious rites. The liturgy of the Church presupposes, integrates and sanctifies 
elements from creation and human culture, conferring on them the dignity of signs of grace, of the 
new creation in Jesus Christ. (843) 

1150 Signs of the covenant. The Chosen People received from God distinctive signs and symbols 
that marked its liturgical life. These are no longer solely celebrations of cosmic cycles and social 
gestures, but signs of the covenant, symbols of God’s mighty deeds for his people. Among these 
liturgical signs from the Old Covenant are circumcision, anointing and consecration of kings and 
priests, laying on of hands, sacrifices, and above all the Passover. The Church sees in these signs a 
prefiguring of the sacraments of the New Covenant. ( 1334 1 

1151 Signs taken up by Christ In his preaching the Lord Jesus often makes use of the signs of 
creation to make known the mysteries of the Kingdom of God.l^ He performs healings and 
illustrates his preaching with physical signs or symbolic gestures.^ He gives new meaning to the 
deeds and signs of the Old Covenant, above all to the Exodus and the Passover,^ for he himself is 
the meaning of all these signs. (1335) 

1152 Sacramental signs. Since Pentecost, it is through the sacramental signs of his Church that the 
Holy Spirit carries on the work of sanctification. The sacraments of the Church do not abolish but 
purify and integrate all the richness of the signs and symbols of the cosmos and of social life. 
Further, they fulfill the types and figures of the Old Covenant, signify and make actively present 
the salvation wrought by Christ, and prefigure and anticipate the glory of heaven. 

Words and actions 

1153 A sacramental celebration is a meeting of God’s children with their Father, in Christ and the 
Holy Spirit; this meeting takes the form of a dialogue, through actions and words. Admittedly, the 
symbolic actions are already a language, but the Word of God and the response of faith have to 
accompany and give life to them, so that the seed of the Kingdom can bear its fruit in good soil. 
The liturgical actions signify what the Word of God expresses: both his free initiative and his 
people’s response of faith. (53) 

1154 The liturgy of the Word is an integral part of sacramental celebrations. To nourish the faith of 
believers, the signs which accompany the Word of God should be emphasized: the book of the 





Word (a lectionary or a book of the Gospels), its veneration (procession, incense, candles), the 
place of its proclamation (lectern or ambo), its audible and intelligible reading, the minister’s 
homily which extends its proclamation, and the responses of the assembly (acclamations, 
meditation psalms, litanies, and profession of faith). (1100, 103 1 

1155 The liturgical word and action are inseparable both insofar as they are signs and instruction 
and insofar as they accomplish what they signify. When the Holy Spirit awakens faith, he not only 
gives an understanding of the Word of God, but through the sacraments also makes present the 
“wonders” of God which it proclaims. The Spirit makes present and communicates the Father’s 
work, fulfilled by the beloved Son. ( 1127 ) 

Singing and music 

1156 “The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of inestimable value, greater even 
than that of any other art. The main reason for this pre-eminence is that, as a combination of sacred 
music and words, it forms a necessary or integral part of solemn liturgy.”^ The composition and 
singing of inspired psalms, often accompanied by musical instruments, were already closely linked 
to the liturgical celebrations of the Old Covenant. The Church continues and develops this 
tradition: “Address... one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making 
melody to the Lord with all your heart.” “He who sings prays twice. ”21 

1157 Song and music fulfill their function as signs in a manner all the more significant when they 
are “more closely connected... with the liturgical action,”^ according to three principal criteria: 
beauty expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the assembly at the designated 
moments, and the solemn character of the celebration. In this way they participate in the purpose of 
the liturgical words and actions: the glory of God and the sanctification of the faithful:^ (2502) 

How I wept, deeply moved by your hymns, songs, and the voices that echoed through your 
Church! What emotion I experienced in them! Those sounds flowed into my ears, distilling the 
truth in my heart. A feeling of devotion surged within me, and tears streamed down my face— 
tears that did me good.^ 

1158 The harmony of signs (song, music, words, and actions) is all the more expressive and fruitful 
when expressed in the cultural richness of the People of God who celebrate.^ Hence “religious 
singing by the faithful is to be intelligently fostered so that in devotions and sacred exercises as 
well as in liturgical services,” in conformity with the Church’s norms, “the voices of the faithful 
may be heard.” But “the texts intended to be sung must always be in conformity with Catholic 







doctrine. Indeed they should be drawn chiefly from the Sacred Scripture and from liturgical 
sources ”26 1 1201 . 1674 1 


Holy images 476-477 . 2129-2132 

1159 The sacred image, the liturgical icon, principally represents Christ. It cannot represent the 
invisible and incomprehensible God, but the incarnation of the Son of God has ushered in a new 
“economy” of images: 

Previously God, who has neither a body nor a face, absolutely could not be represented by an 
image. But now that he has made himself visible in the flesh and has lived with men, I can 
make an image of what I have seen of God... and contemplate the glory of the Lord, his face 
unveiled.22 

1160 Christian iconography expresses in images the same Gospel message that Scripture 
communicates by words. Image and word illuminate each other: 

We declare that we preserve intact all the written and unwritten traditions of the Church which 
have been entrusted to us. One of these traditions consists in the production of representational 
artwork, which accords with the history of the preaching of the Gospel. For it confirms that the 
incarnation of the Word of God was real and not imaginary, and to our benefit as well, for 
realities that illustrate each other undoubtedly reflect each other’s meaning.22 

1161 All the signs in the liturgical celebrations are related to Christ: as are sacred images of the 
holy Mother of God and of the saints as well. They truly signify Christ, who is glorified in them. 
They make manifest the “cloud of witnesses”^ who continue to participate in the salvation of the 
world and to whom we are united, above all in sacramental celebrations. Through their icons, it is 
man “in the image of God,” finally transfigured “into his likeness, ”22 who is revealed to our faith. 
So too are the angels, who also are recapitulated in Christ: 

Following the divinely inspired teaching of our holy Fathers and the tradition of the Catholic 
Church (for we know that this tradition comes from the Holy Spirit who dwells in her) we 
rightly define with full certainty and correctness that, like the figure of the precious and life- 
giving cross, venerable and holy images of our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ, our 
inviolate Lady, the holy Mother of God, and the venerated angels, all the saints and the just, 
whether painted or made of mosaic or another suitable material, are to be exhibited in the holy 
churches of God, on sacred vessels and vestments, walls and panels, in houses and on 






streets.^ 


1162 “The beauty of the images moves me to contemplation, as a meadow delights the eyes and 
subtly infuses the soul with the glory of God.”22 Similarly, the contemplation of sacred icons, 
united with meditation on the Word of God and the singing of liturgical hymns, enters into the 
harmony of the signs of celebration so that the mystery celebrated is imprinted in the heart’s 
memory and is then expressed in the new life of the faithful. (2502) 

III. When Is the Liturgy Celebrated? 

Liturgical seasons 

1163 “Holy Mother Church believes that she should celebrate the saving work of her divine Spouse 
in a sacred commemoration on certain days throughout the course of the year. Once each week, on 
the day which she has called the Lord’s Day, she keeps the memory of the Lord’s resurrection. She 
also celebrates it once every year, together with his blessed Passion, at Easter, that most solemn of 
all feasts. In the course of the year, moreover, she unfolds the whole mystery of Christ.... Thus 
recalling the mysteries of the redemption, she opens up to the faithful the riches of her Lord’s 
powers and merits, so that these are in some way made present in every age; the faithful lay hold of 
them and are filled with saving grace. ”23 (512) 

1164 From the time of the Mosaic law, the People of God have observed fixed feasts, beginning 
with Passover, to commemorate the astonishing actions of the Savior God, to give him thanks for 
them, to perpetuate their remembrance, and to teach new generations to conform their conduct to 
them. In the age of the Church, between the Passover of Christ already accomplished once for all, 
and its consummation in the kingdom of God, the liturgy celebrated on fixed days bears the imprint 
of the newness of the mystery of Christ. 

1165 When the Church celebrates the mystery of Christ, there is a word that marks her prayer: 
“Today!” — a word echoing the prayer her Lord taught her and the call of the Holy Spirit.^ This 
“today” of the living God which man is called to enter is “the hour” of Jesus’ Passover, which 
reaches across and underlies all history: 1 2659-2836 . 1085 1 

Life extends over all beings and fills them with unlimited light; the Orient of orients pervades 
the universe, and he who was “before the daystar” and before the heavenly bodies, immortal 
and vast, the great Christ, shines over all beings more brightly than the sun. Therefore a day of 
long, eternal light is ushered in for us who believe in him, a day which is never blotted out: the 






mystical Passover.^ 


The Lord’s day 2174-2188 

1166 “By a tradition handed down from the apostles which took its origin from the very day of 
Christ’s Resurrection, the Church celebrates the Paschal mystery every seventh day, which day is 
appropriately called the Lord’s Day or Sunday.The day of Christ’s Resurrection is both the first 
day of the week, the memorial of the first day of creation, and the “eighth day,” on which Christ 
after his “rest” on the great sabbath inaugurates the “day that the Lord has made,” the “day that 
knows no evening.”^ The Lord’s Supper is its center, for there the whole community of the 
faithful encounters the risen Lord who invites them to his banquet:^ (1343 ) 

The Lord’s day, the day of Resurrection, the day of Christians, is our day. It is called the 
Lord’s day because on it the Lord rose victorious to the Father. If pagans call it the “day of the 
sun,” we willingly agree, for today the light of the world is raised, today is revealed the sun of 
justice with healing in his rays.^ 

1167 Sunday is the pre-eminent day for the liturgical assembly, when the faithful gather “to listen 
to the word of God and take part in the Eucharist, thus calling to mind the Passion, Resurrection, 
and glory of the Lord Jesus, and giving thanks to God who 'has begotten them again, by the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead’ unto a living hope”;4Q 

When we ponder, O Christ, the marvels accomplished on this day, the Sunday of your holy 
resurrection, we say: “Blessed is Sunday, for on it began creation... the world’s salvation... the 
renewal of the human race.... On Sunday heaven and earth rejoiced and the whole universe 
was filled with light. Blessed is Sunday, for on it were opened the gates of paradise so that 
Adam and all the exiles might enter it without fear.41 

The liturgical year 

1168 Beginning with the Easter Triduum as its source of light, the new age of the Resurrection fills 
the whole liturgical year with its brilliance. Gradually, on either side of this source, the year is 
transfigured by the liturgy. It really is a “year of the Lord’s favor. ”42 The economy of salvation is 
at work within the framework of time, but since its fulfillment in the Passover of Jesus and the 
outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the culmination of history is anticipated “as a foretaste,” and the 
kingdom of God enters into our time. (2698) 





1169 Therefore Easter is not simply one feast among others, but the “Feast of feasts,” the 
“Solemnity of solemnities,” just as the Eucharist is the “Sacrament of sacraments” (the Great 
Sacrament). St. Athanasius calls Easter “the Great Sunday”^ and the Eastern Churches call Holy 
Week “the Great Week.” The mystery of the Resurrection, in which Christ crushed death, 
permeates with its powerful energy our old time, until all is subjected to him. ( 1330 . 560 ) 

1170 At the Council of Nicaea in 325, all the Churches agreed that Easter, the Christian Passover, 
should be celebrated on the Sunday following the first full moon (14 Nisan) after the vernal 
equinox. Because of different methods of calculating the 14th day of the month of Nisan, the date 
of Easter in the Western and Eastern Churches is not always the same. For this reason, the 
Churches are currently seeking an agreement in order once again to celebrate the day of the Lord’s 
Resurrection on a common date. 

1171 In the liturgical year the various aspects of the one Paschal mystery unfold. This is also the 
case with the cycle of feasts surrounding the mystery of the incarnation (Annunciation, Christmas, 
Epiphany). They commemorate the beginning of our salvation and communicate to us the first 
fruits of the Paschal mystery. (524) 

The sanctoral in the liturgical year 

1172 “In celebrating this annual cycle of the mysteries of Christ, Holy Church honors the Blessed 
Mary, Mother of God, with a special love. She is inseparably linked with the saving work of her 
Son. In her the Church admires and exalts the most excellent fruit of redemption and joyfully 
contemplates, as in a faultless image, that which she herself desires and hopes wholly to be. ”44 
1 971 . 2030 ) 

1173 When the Church keeps the memorials of martyrs and other saints during the annual cycle, 
she proclaims the Paschal mystery in those “who have suffered and have been glorified with Christ. 
She proposes them to the faithful as examples who draw all men to the Father through Christ, and 
through their merits she begs for God’s favors. ”42 ( 957 ) 

The Liturgy of the Hours 

1174 The mystery of Christ, his Incarnation and Passover, which we celebrate in the Eucharist 
especially at the Sunday assembly, permeates and transfigures the time of each day, through the 
celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours, “the divine office. ”42 This celebration, faithful to the 
apostolic exhortations to “pray constantly,” is “so devised that the whole course of the day and 
night is made holy by the praise of God.”42 In this “public prayer of the Church, ”42 the faithful 








(clergy, religious, and lay people) exercise the royal priesthood of the baptized. Celebrated in “the 
form approved” by the Church, the Liturgy of the Hours “is truly the voice of the Bride herself 
addressed to her Bridegroom. It is the very prayer which Christ himself together with his Body 
addresses to the Father.”^ (2698) 

1175 The Liturgy of the Hours is intended to become the prayer of the whole People of God. In it 
Christ himself “continues his priestly work through his Church.”S2 His members participate 
according to their own place in the Church and the circumstances of their lives: priests devoted to 
the pastoral ministry, because they are called to remain diligent in prayer and the service of the 
word; religious, by the charism of their consecrated lives; all the faithful as much as possible: 
“Pastors of souls should see to it that the principal hours, especially Vespers, are celebrated in 
common in church on Sundays and on the more solemn feasts. The laity, too, are encouraged to 
recite the divine office, either with the priests, or among themselves, or even individually.”^ 

1176 The celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours demands not only harmonizing the voice with the 
praying heart, but also a deeper “understanding of the liturgy and of the Bible, especially of the 
Psalms.”^ (2700) 

1177 The hymns and litanies of the Liturgy of the Hours integrate the prayer of the psalms into the 
age of the Church, expressing the symbolism of the time of day, the liturgical season, or the feast 
being celebrated. Moreover, the reading from the Word of God at each Hour (with the subsequent 
responses or troparia ) and readings from the Fathers and spiritual masters at certain Hours, reveal 
more deeply the meaning of the mystery being celebrated, assist in understanding the psalms, and 
prepare for silent prayer. The lectio divina, where the Word of God is so read and meditated that it 
becomes prayer, is thus rooted in the liturgical celebration. (2586) 

1178 The Liturgy of the Hours, which is like an extension of the Eucharistic celebration, does not 
exclude but rather in a complementary way calls forth the various devotions of the People of God, 
especially adoration and worship of the Blessed Sacrament. (1378) 

IV. Where Is the Liturgy Celebrated? 

1179 The worship “in Spirit and in truth”S3 of the New Covenant is not tied exclusively to any one 
place. The whole earth is sacred and entrusted to the children of men. What matters above all is 
that, when the faithful assemble in the same place, they are the “living stones,” gathered to be “built 
into a spiritual house. ”^4 For the Body of the risen Christ is the spiritual temple from which the 






source of living water springs forth: incorporated into Christ by the Holy Spirit, “we are the temple 
of the living God.”^ (586) 


1180 When the exercise of religious liberty is not thwarted,^ Christians construct buildings for 
divine worship. These visible churches are not simply gathering places but signify and make visible 
the Church living in this place, the dwelling of God with men reconciled and united in Christ. 
(2106) 

1181 A church, “a house of prayer in which the Eucharist is celebrated and reserved, where the 
faithful assemble, and where is worshipped the presence of the Son of God our Savior, offered for 
us on the sacrificial altar for the help and consolation of the faithful—this house ought to be in 
good taste and a worthy place for prayer and sacred ceremonial.”^ In this “house of God” the truth 
and the harmony of the signs that make it up should show Christ to be present and active in this 
placed (2691) 

1182 The altar of the New Covenant is the Lord’s Cross, ^ from which the sacraments of the 
Paschal mystery flow. On the altar, which is the center of the church, the sacrifice of the Cross is 
made present under sacramental signs. The altar is also the table of the Lord, to which the People of 
God are invited.^ In certain Eastern liturgies, the altar is also the symbol of the tomb (Christ truly 
died and is truly risen). 1 617 . 1383 1 

1183 The tabernacle is to be situated “in churches in a most worthy place with the greatest 
honor.”^i The dignity, placing, and security of the Eucharistic tabernacle should foster adoration 
before the Lord really present in the Blessed Sacrament of the altar.^2 ( 1379 . 2120 . 1241 1 

The sacred chrism ( myron ), used in anointings as the sacramental sign of the seal of the gift of 
the Holy Spirit, is traditionally reserved and venerated in a secure place in the sanctuary. The oil of 
catechumens and the oil of the sick may also be placed there. 

1184 The chair of the bishop ( cathedra ) or that of the priest “should express his office of presiding 
over the assembly and of directing prayer.”h3 ( 1348 . 103 1 

The lectern ( ambo ): “The dignity of the Word of God requires the church to have a suitable 
place for announcing his message so that the attention of the people may be easily directed to that 
place during the liturgy of the Word.”^ 

1185 The gathering of the People of God begins with Baptism; a church must have a place for the 
celebration of Baptism (baptistry) and for fostering remembrance of the baptismal promises (holy 
water font). (2717 ) 













The renewal of the baptismal life requires penance. A church, then, must lend itself to the 
expression of repentance and the reception of forgiveness, which requires an appropriate place to 
receive penitents. 

A church must also be a space that invites us to the recollection and silent prayer that extend 
and internalize the great prayer of the Eucharist. 

1186 Finally, the church has an eschatological significance. To enter into the house of God, we 
must cross a threshold, which symbolizes passing from the world wounded by sin to the world of 
the new Life to which all men are called. The visible church is a symbol of the Father’s house 
toward which the People of God is journeying and where the Father “will wipe every tear from 
their eyes . ”^2 Also for this reason, the Church is the house of all God’s children, open and 
welcoming. ( 1130 ) 


IN BRIEF 

1187 The liturgy is the work of the whole Christ, head and body. Our high priest celebrates it 
unceasingly in the heavenly liturgy, with the holy Mother of God, the apostles, all the saints, and 
the multitude of those who have already entered the kingdom. 

1188 In a liturgical celebration, the whole assembly is leitourgos, each member according to his 
own function. The baptismal priesthood is that of the whole Body of Christ. But some of the 
faithful are ordained through the sacrament of Holy Orders to represent Christ as head of the Body. 

1189 The liturgical celebration involves signs and symbols relating to creation (candles, water, 
fire), human life (washing, anointing, breaking bread), and the history of salvation (the rites of the 
Passover). Integrated into the world of faith and taken up by the power of the Holy Spirit, these 
cosmic elements, human rituals, and gestures of remembrance of God become bearers of the saving 
and sanctifying action of Christ. 

1190 The Liturgy of the Word is an integral part of the celebration. The meaning of the celebration 
is expressed by the Word of God which is proclaimed and by the response of faith to it. 

1191 Song and music are closely connected with the liturgical action. The criteria for their proper 
use are the beauty expressive of prayer, the unanimous participation of the assembly, and the sacred 
character of the celebration. 





1192 Sacred images in our churches and homes are intended to awaken and nourish our faith in the 
mystery of Christ. Through the icon of Christ and his works of salvation, it is he whom we adore. 
Through sacred images of the holy Mother of God, of the angels and of the saints, we venerate the 
persons represented. 

1193 Sunday, the “Lord’s Day,” is the principal day for the celebration of the Eucharist because it 
is the day of the Resurrection. It is the pre-eminent day of the liturgical assembly, the day of the 
Christian family, and the day of joy and rest from work. Sunday is “the foundation and kernel of 
the whole liturgical year” (SC 106). 

1194 The Church, “in the course of the year,... unfolds the whole mystery of Christ from his 
Incarnation and Nativity through his Ascension, to Pentecost and the expectation of the blessed 
hope of the coming of the Lord” (SC 102 § 2). 

1195 By keeping the memorials of the saints—first of all the holy Mother of God, then the apostles, 
the martyrs, and other saints—on fixed days of the liturgical year, the Church on earth shows that 
she is united with the liturgy of heaven. She gives glory to Christ for having accomplished his 
salvation in his glorified members; their example encourages her on her way to the Father. 

1196 The faithful who celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours are united to Christ our high priest, by the 
prayer of the Psalms, meditation on the Word of God, and canticles and blessings, in order to be 
joined with his unceasing and universal prayer that gives glory to the Father and implores the gift 
of the Holy Spirit on the whole world. 

1197 Christ is the true temple of God, “the place where his glory dwells”; by the grace of God, 
Christians also become temples of the Holy Spirit, living stones out of which the Church is built. 

1198 In its earthly state the Church needs places where the community can gather together. Our 
visible churches, holy places, are images of the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, toward which we 
are making our way on pilgrimage. 

1199 It is in these churches that the Church celebrates public worship to the glory of the Holy 
Trinity, hears the word of God and sings his praise, lifts up her prayer, and offers the sacrifice of 
Christ sacramentally present in the midst of the assembly. These churches are also places of 
recollection and personal prayer. 


ARTICLE 2 







LITURGICAL DIVERSITY AND THE UNITY OF THE MYSTERY 


Liturgical traditions and the catholicity of the Church 

1200 From the first community of Jerusalem until the parousia, it is the same Paschal mystery that 
the Churches of God, faithful to the apostolic faith, celebrate in every place. The mystery 
celebrated in the liturgy is one, but the forms of its celebration are diverse. ( 2625 1 

1201 The mystery of Christ is so unfathomably rich that it cannot be exhausted by its expression in 
any single liturgical tradition. The history of the blossoming and development of these rites 
witnesses to a remarkable complementarity. When the Churches lived their respective liturgical 
traditions in the communion of the faith and the sacraments of the faith, they enriched one another 
and grew in fidelity to Tradition and to the common mission of the whole Church.^ ( 2663 . 1158 1 

1202 The diverse liturgical traditions have arisen by very reason of the Church’s mission. Churches 
of the same geographical and cultural area came to celebrate the mystery of Christ through 
particular expressions characterized by the culture: in the tradition of the “deposit of faith, ”§2 in 
liturgical symbolism, in the organization of fraternal communion, in the theological understanding 
of the mysteries, and in various forms of holiness. Through the liturgical life of a local church, 
Christ, the light and salvation of all peoples, is made manifest to the particular people and culture to 
which that Church is sent and in which she is rooted. The Church is catholic, capable of integrating 
into her unity, while purifying them, all the authentic riches of cultures.^ ( 814 . 1674 . 835 . 1937 1 

1203 The liturgical traditions or rites presently in use in the Church are the Latin (principally the 
Roman rite, but also the rites of certain local churches, such as the Ambrosian rite, or those of 
certain religious orders) and the Byzantine, Alexandrian or Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, Maronite, 
and Chaldean rites. In “faithful obedience to tradition, the sacred Council declares that Holy 
Mother Church holds all lawfully recognized rites to be of equal right and dignity, and that she 
wishes to preserve them in the future and to foster them in every way.”^ 

Liturgy and culture 

1204 The celebration of the liturgy, therefore, should correspond to the genius and culture of the 
different peoples.22 In order that the mystery of Christ be “made known to all the nations... to bring 
about the obedience of faith, it must be proclaimed, celebrated, and lived in all cultures in such a 
way that they themselves are not abolished by it, but redeemed and fulfilled:^ It is with and 












through their own human culture, assumed and transfigured by Christ, that the multitude of God’s 
children has access to the Father, in order to glorify him in the one Spirit. (2684, 854 . 1232 . 2527 1 

1205 “In the liturgy, above all that of the sacraments, there is an immutable part, a part that is 
divinely instituted and of which the Church is the guardian, and parts that can be changed, which 
the Church has the power and on occasion also the duty to adapt to the cultures of recently 
evangelized peoples.”^ ( 1125 ) 

1206 “Liturgical diversity can be a source of enrichment, but it can also provoke tensions, mutual 
misunderstandings, and even schisms. In this matter it is clear that diversity must not damage unity. 
It must express only fidelity to the common faith, to the sacramental signs that the Church has 
received from Christ, and to hierarchical communion. Cultural adaptation also requires a 
conversion of heart and even, where necessary, a breaking with ancestral customs incompatible 
with the Catholic faith.”^ 


IN BRIEF 

1207 It is fitting that liturgical celebration tends to express itself in the culture of the people where 
the Church finds herself, though without being submissive to it. Moreover, the liturgy itself 
generates cultures and shapes them. 

1208 The diverse liturgical traditions or rites, legitimately recognized, manifest the catholicity of 
the Church, because they signify and communicate the same mystery of Christ. 

1209 The criterion that assures unity amid the diversity of liturgical traditions is fidelity to 
apostolic Tradition, i.e., the communion in the faith and the sacraments received from the apostles, 
a communion that is both signified and guaranteed by apostolic succession.

SECTION TWO 

THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH 


1210 Christ instituted the sacraments of the new law. There are seven: Baptism, Confirmation (or 
Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony. The 
seven sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life;i they give 
birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian’s life of faith. There is thus a certain 
resemblance between the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life. ( 1113 1 

1211 Following this analogy, the first chapter will expound the three sacraments of Christian 
initiation; the second, the sacraments of healing; and the third, the sacraments at the service of 
communion and the mission of the faithful. This order, while not the only one possible, does allow 
one to see that the sacraments form an organic whole in which each particular sacrament has its 
own vital place. In this organic whole, the Eucharist occupies a unique place as the “Sacrament of 
sacraments”: “all the other sacraments are ordered to it as to their end.”^ ( 1374 1 




CHAPTER ONE 

THE SACRAMENTS OF CHRISTIAN INITIATION 


1212 The sacraments of Christian initiation—Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist—lay the 
foundations of every Christian life. “The sharing in the divine nature given to men through the 
grace of Christ bears a certain likeness to the origin, development, and nourishing of natural life. 
The faithful are born anew by Baptism, strengthened by the sacrament of Confirmation, and receive 
in the Eucharist the food of eternal life. By means of these sacraments of Christian initiation, they 
thus receive in increasing measure the treasures of the divine life and advance toward the perfection 
of charity. ”3 

ARTICLE 1 

THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM 


1213 Holy Baptism is the basis of the whole Christian life, the gateway to life in the Spirit ( vitae 
spiritualis ianua ),4 and the door which gives access to the other sacraments. Through Baptism we 
are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into 
the Church and made sharers in her mission: “Baptism is the sacrament of regeneration through 
water and in the word.”^ 

I. What Is this Sacrament Called? 

1214 This sacrament is called Baptism, after the central rite by which it is carried out: to baptize 
(Greek baptizein ) means to “plunge” or “immerse”; the “plunge” into the water symbolizes the 
catechumen’s burial into Christ’s death, from which he rises up by resurrection with him, as “a new 
creature. (628) 

1215 This sacrament is also called “the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit,” 
for it signifies and actually brings about the birth of water and the Spirit without which no one “can 
enter the kingdom of God.”^ ( 1257 ) 

1216 “This bath is called enlightenment, because those who receive this [catechetical] instruction 
are enlightened in their understanding....Having received in Baptism the Word, “the true light 
that enlightens every man,” the person baptized has been “enlightened,” he becomes a “son of 
light,” indeed, he becomes “light” himself:^ ( 1243 ) 







Baptism is God’s most beautiful and magnificent gift.... We call it gift, grace, anointing, 
enlightenment, garment of immortality, bath of rebirth, seal, and most precious gift. It is called 
gift because it is conferred on those who bring nothing of their own; grace since it is given 
even to the guilty; Baptism because sin is buried in the water; anointing for it is priestly and 
royal as are those who are anointed; enlightenment because it radiates light; clothing since it 
veils our shame; bath because it washes; and seal as it is our guard and the sign of God’s 

Lordship.J^ 

II. Baptism in the Economy of Salvation 

Prefigurations of Baptism in the Old Covenant 

1217 In the liturgy of the Easter Vigil, during the blessing of the baptismal water, the Church 
solemnly commemorates the great events in salvation history that already prefigured the mystery of 
Baptism: 

Father, you give us grace through sacramental signs, 
which tell us of the wonders of your unseen power. 

In Baptism we use your gift of water, 

which you have made a rich symbol 

of the grace you give us in this sacrament.hl 

1218 Since the beginning of the world, water, so humble and wonderful a creature, has been the 
source of life and fruitfulness. Sacred Scripture sees it as “overshadowed” by the Spirit of God:^ 
1 344 . 694 1 

At the very dawn of creation 

your Spirit breathed on the waters, 

making them the wellspring of all holiness.^ 

1219 The Church has seen in Noah’s ark a prefiguring of salvation by Baptism, for by it “a few, 
that is, eight persons, were saved through water” ‘M (701, 845 1 

The waters of the great flood 

you made a sign of the waters of Baptism, 

that make an end of sin and a new beginning of goodness.^ 






1220 If water springing up from the earth symbolizes life, the water of the sea is a symbol of death 
and so can represent the mystery of the cross. By this symbolism Baptism signifies communion 
with Christ’s death. ( 1010 1 

1221 But above all, the crossing of the Red Sea, literally the liberation of Israel from the slavery of 
Egypt, announces the liberation wrought by Baptism: 

You freed the children of Abraham from the slavery of Pharaoh, 
bringing them dry-shod through the waters of the Red Sea, 
to be an image of the people set free in Baptism.!! 

1222 Finally, Baptism is prefigured in the crossing of the Jordan River by which the People of God 
received the gift of the land promised to Abraham’s descendants, an image of eternal life. The 
promise of this blessed inheritance is fulfilled in the New Covenant. 

Christ’s Baptism 

1223 All the Old Covenant prefigurations find their fulfillment in Christ Jesus. He begins his public 
life after having himself baptized by St. John the Baptist in the Jordan.!! After his resurrection 
Christ gives this mission to his apostles: “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing 
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all 
that I have commanded you.”!! (232) 

1224 Our Ford voluntarily submitted himself to the baptism of St. John, intended for sinners, in 
order to “fulfill all righteousness.”!! Jesus’ gesture is a manifestation of his self-emptying.!! The 
Spirit who had hovered over the waters of the first creation descended then on the Christ as a 
prelude of the new creation, and the Father revealed Jesus as his “beloved Son.”!! (536) 

1225 In his Passover Christ opened to all men the fountain of Baptism. He had already spoken of 
his Passion, which he was about to suffer in Jerusalem, as a “Baptism” with which he had to be 
baptized.!! The blood and water that flowed from the pierced side of the crucified Jesus are types 
of Baptism and the Eucharist, the sacraments of new life.!! From then on, it is possible “to be born 
of water and the Spirit”!^ in order to enter the Kingdom of God. 1 766 1 

See where you are baptized, see where Baptism comes from, if not from the cross of Christ, 
from his death. There is the whole mystery: he died for you. In him you are redeemed, in him 
you are saved.!! 






Baptism in the Church 


1226 From the very day of Pentecost the Church has celebrated and administered holy Baptism. 
Indeed St. Peter declares to the crowd astounded by his preaching: “Repent, and be baptized every 
one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the 
gift of the Holy Spirit.”^ The apostles and their collaborators offer Baptism to anyone who 
believed in Jesus: Jews, the God-fearing, pagans.-? Always, Baptism is seen as connected with 
faith: “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household,” St. Paul declared 
to his jailer in Philippi. And the narrative continues, the jailer “was baptized at once, with all his 
family (849) 

1227 According to the Apostle Paul, the believer enters through Baptism into communion with 
Christ’s death, is buried with him, and rises with him: ( 790 1 

Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his 
death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised 
from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.^H 

The baptized have “put on Christ.”^ Through the Holy Spirit, Baptism is a bath that purifies, 
justifies, and sanctifies.^ 

1228 Hence Baptism is a bath of water in which the “imperishable seed” of the Word of God 
produces its life-giving effect.^ St. Augustine says of Baptism: “The word is brought to the 
material element, and it becomes a sacrament.”^ 

III. How Is the Sacrament of Baptism Celebrated? 

Christian Initiation 

1229 From the time of the apostles, becoming a Christian has been accomplished by a journey and 
initiation in several stages. This journey can be covered rapidly or slowly, but certain essential 
elements will always have to be present: proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the Gospel 
entailing conversion, profession of faith, Baptism itself, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and 
admission to Eucharistic communion. 

1230 This initiation has varied greatly through the centuries according to circumstances. In the first 
centuries of the Church, Christian initiation saw considerable development. A long period of 




catechumenate included a series of preparatory rites, which were liturgical landmarks along the 
path of catechumenal preparation and culminated in the celebration of the sacraments of Christian 
initiation. ( 1248 ) 

1231 Where infant Baptism has become the form in which this sacrament is usually celebrated, it 
has become a single act encapsulating the preparatory stages of Christian initiation in a very 
abridged way. By its very nature infant Baptism requires a post-baptismal catechumenate. Not only 
is there a need for instruction after Baptism, but also for the necessary flowering of baptismal grace 
in personal growth. The catechism has its proper place here. (13) 

1232 The second Vatican Council restored for the Latin Church “the catechumenate for adults, 
comprising several distinct steps.”24 The rites for these stages are to be found in the Rite of 
Christian Initiation of Adults (RCIA ).^S The Council also gives permission that: “In mission 
countries, in addition to what is furnished by the Christian tradition, those elements of initiation 
rites may be admitted which are already in use among some peoples insofar as they can be adapted 
to the Christian ritual.”^ (1204) 

1233 Today in all the rites, Latin and Eastern, the Christian initiation of adults begins with their 
entry into the catechumenate and reaches its culmination in a single celebration of the three 
sacraments of initiation: Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist.22 In the Eastern rites the 
Christian initiation of infants also begins with Baptism followed immediately by Confirmation and 
the Eucharist, while in the Roman rite it is followed by years of catechesis before being completed 
later by Confirmation and the Eucharist, the summit of their Christian initiation.^ 

The mystagogy of the celebration 

1234 The meaning and grace of the sacrament of Baptism are clearly seen in the rites of its 
celebration. By following the gestures and words of this celebration with attentive participation, the 
faithful are initiated into the riches this sacrament signifies and actually brings about in each newly 
baptized person. 

1235 The sign of the cross, on the threshold of the celebration, marks with the imprint of Christ the 
one who is going to belong to him and signifies the grace of the redemption Christ won for us by 
his cross. 1 617 . 2157 1 

1236 The proclamation of the Word of God enlightens the candidates and the assembly with the 
revealed truth and elicits the response of faith, which is inseparable from Baptism. Indeed Baptism 






is “the sacrament of faith” in a particular way, since it is the sacramental entry into the life of faith. 

( 1112 ) 


1237 Since Baptism signifies liberation from sin and from its instigator the devil, one or more 
exorcisms are pronounced over the candidate. The celebrant then anoints him with the oil of 
catechumens, or lays his hands on him, and he explicitly renounces Satan. Thus prepared, he is able 
to confess the faith of the Church, to which he will be “entrusted” by Baptism.^ ( 1673 . 189 1 

1238 The baptismal water is consecrated by a prayer of epiclesis (either at this moment or at the 
Easter Vigil). The Church asks God that through his Son the power of the Holy Spirit may be sent 
upon the water, so that those who will be baptized in it may be “born of water and the Spirit.”^ 
( 1217 ) 

1239 The essential rite of the sacrament follows: Baptism properly speaking. It signifies and 
actually brings about death to sin and entry into the life of the Most Holy Trinity through 
configuration to the Paschal mystery of Christ. Baptism is performed in the most expressive way by 
triple immersion in the baptismal water. However, from ancient times it has also been able to be 
conferred by pouring the water three times over the candidate’s head. (1214) 

1240 In the Latin Church this triple infusion is accompanied by the minister’s words: “N., I baptize 
you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” In the Eastern liturgies the 
catechumen turns toward the East and the priest says: “The servant of God, N., is baptized in the 
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” At the invocation of each person of the 
Most Holy Trinity, the priest immerses the candidate in the water and raises him up again. 

1241 The anointing with sacred chrism, perfumed oil consecrated by the bishop, signifies the gift 
of the Holy Spirit to the newly baptized, who has become a Christian, that is, one “anointed” by the 
Holy Spirit, incorporated into Christ who is anointed priest, prophet, and king.41 ( 1294 . 1574 . 783 1 

1242 In the liturgy of the Eastern Churches, the post-baptismal anointing is the sacrament of 
Chrismation (Confirmation). In the Roman liturgy the post-baptismal anointing announces a second 
anointing with sacred chrism to be conferred later by the bishop—Confirmation, which will as it 
were “confirm” and complete the baptismal anointing. ( 1291 1 

1243 The white garment symbolizes that the person baptized has “put on Christ,”42 has risen with 
Christ. The candle, lit from the Easter candle, signifies that Christ has enlightened the neophyte. In 
him the baptized are “the light of the world.”43 ( 1216 . 2769 1 













The newly baptized is now, in the only Son, a child of God entitled to say the prayer of the 
children of God: “Our Father.” 

1244 First Holy Communion. Having become a child of God clothed with the wedding garment, the 
neophyte is admitted “to the marriage supper of the Lamb”^ and receives the food of the new life, 
the body and blood of Christ. The Eastern Churches maintain a lively awareness of the unity of 
Christian initiation by giving Holy Communion to all the newly baptized and confirmed, even little 
children, recalling the Lord’s words: “Let the children come to me, do not hinder them.”^ The 
Latin Church, which reserves admission to Holy Communion to those who have attained the age of 
reason, expresses the orientation of Baptism to the Eucharist by having the newly baptized child 
brought to the altar for the praying of the Our Lather. ( 1292 1 

1245 The solemn blessing concludes the celebration of Baptism. At the Baptism of newborns the 
blessing of the mother occupies a special place. 

IV. Who Can Receive Baptism? 

1246 “Every person not yet baptized and only such a person is able to be baptized.”^ 

The Baptism of adults 

1247 Since the beginning of the Church, adult Baptism is the common practice where the 
proclamation of the Gospel is still new. The catechumenate (preparation for Baptism) therefore 
occupies an important place. This initiation into Christian faith and life should dispose the 
catechumen to receive the gift of God in Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist. 

1248 The catechumenate, or formation of catechumens, aims at bringing their conversion and faith 
to maturity, in response to the divine initiative and in union with an ecclesial community. The 
catechumenate is to be “a formation in the whole Christian life... during which the disciples will be 
joined to Christ their teacher. The catechumens should be properly initiated into the mystery of 
salvation and the practice of the evangelical virtues, and they should be introduced into the life of 
faith, liturgy, and charity of the People of God by successive sacred rites. ( 1230 ) 

1249 Catechumens “are already joined to the Church, they are already of the household of Christ, 
and are quite frequently already living a life of faith, hope, and charity. “With love and 
solicitude mother Church already embraces them as her own.”^9 ( 1259 1 





The Baptism of infants 


1250 Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin, children also have need of the 
new birth in Baptism to be freed from the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the 
freedom of the children of God, to which all men are called.^ The sheer gratuitousness of the grace 
of salvation is particularly manifest in infant Baptism. The Church and the parents would deny a 
child the priceless grace of becoming a child of God were they not to confer Baptism shortly after 
birth.51 (403, 1996 1 

1251 Christian parents will recognize that this practice also accords with their role as nurturers of 
the life that God has entrusted to them.^2 

1252 The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the Church. There is explicit 
testimony to this practice from the second century on, and it is quite possible that, from the 
beginning of the apostolic preaching, when whole “households” received baptism, infants may also 
have been baptized.^ 

Faith and Baptism 

1253 Baptism is the sacrament of faith.^ But faith needs the community of believers. It is only 
within the faith of the Church that each of the faithful can believe. The faith required for Baptism is 
not a perfect and mature faith, but a beginning that is called to ( 1123 . 168 1 

develop. The catechumen or the godparent is asked: “What do you ask of God’s Church?” The 
response is: “Faith!” 

1254 For all the baptized, children or adults, faith must grow after Baptism. For this reason the 
Church celebrates each year at the Easter Vigil the renewal of baptismal promises. Preparation for 
Baptism leads only to the threshold of new life. Baptism is the source of that new life in Christ 
from which the entire Christian life springs forth. 1 2101 1 

1255 For the grace of Baptism to unfold, the parents’ help is important. So too is the role of the 
godfather and godmother, who must be firm believers, able and ready to help the newly baptized— 
child or adult—on the road of Christian life.^ Their task is a truly ecclesial function ( officium ).^ 
The whole ecclesial community bears some responsibility for the development and safeguarding of 
the grace given at Baptism. ( 1311 1 


V. Who Can Baptize? 








1256 The ordinary ministers of Baptism are the bishop and priest and, in the Latin Church, also the 
deacon.-^ In case of necessity, anyone, even a non-baptized person, with the required intention, can 
baptize,^ by using the Trinitarian baptismal formula. The intention required is to will to do what 
the Church does when she baptizes. The Church finds the reason for this possibility in the universal 
saving will of God and the necessity of Baptism for salvation.^2 1 1239-1240 . 1752 1 

VI. The Necessity of Baptism 

1257 The Lord himself affirms that Baptism is necessary for salvation.^ He also commands his 
disciples to proclaim the Gospel to all nations and to baptize them.^1 Baptism is necessary for 
salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of 
asking for this sacrament.^ The Church does not know of any means other than Baptism that 
assures entry into eternal beatitude; this is why she takes care not to neglect the mission she has 
received from the Lord to see that all who can be baptized are “reborn of water and the Spirit.” God 
has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments. 
(1129,161, 846 1 

1258 The Church has always held the firm conviction that those who suffer death for the sake of 
the faith without having received Baptism are baptized by their death for and with Christ. This 
Baptism of blood, like the desire for Baptism, brings about the fruits of Baptism without being a 
sacrament. (2473) 

1259 For catechumens who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with 
repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive 
through the sacrament. ( 1249 1 

1260 “Since Christ died for all, and since all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, 
which is divine, we must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made 
partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.”^ Every man who is ignorant of the 
Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with 
his understanding of it, can be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have desired 
Baptism explicitly if they had known its necessity. (848) 

1261 As regards children who have died without Baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the 
mercy of God, as she does in her funeral rites for them. Indeed, the great mercy of God who desires 
that all men should be saved, and Jesus’ tenderness toward children which caused him to say: “Let 










the children come to me, do not hinder them,”^ allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for 
children who have died without Baptism. All the more urgent is the Church’s call not to prevent 
little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism. ( 1257 . 1250 1 

VII. The Grace of Baptism 

1262 The different effects of Baptism are signified by the perceptible elements of the sacramental 
rite. Immersion in water symbolizes not only death and purification, but also regeneration and 
renewal. Thus the two principal effects are purification from sins and new birth in the Holy 
Spirit.^ 1 1234 1 

For the forgiveness of sins... 

1263 By Baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins, as well as all punishment 
for sin.hh In those who have been reborn nothing remains that would impede their entry into the 
Kingdom of God, neither Adam’s sin, nor personal sin, nor the consequences of sin, the gravest of 
which is separation from God. 1 977 . 1425 1 

1264 Yet certain temporal consequences of sin remain in the baptized, such as suffering, illness, 
death, and such frailties inherent in life as weaknesses of character, and so on, as well as an 
inclination to sin that Tradition calls concupiscence, or metaphorically, “the tinder for sin” ( fomes 
peccati); since concupiscence “is left for us to wrestle with, it cannot harm those who do not 
consent but manfully resist it by the grace of Jesus Christ.”^ Indeed, “an athlete is not crowned 
unless he competes according to the rules. (975, 2514 . 1426 . 405 1 

“A new creature” 

1265 Baptism not only purifies from all sins, but also makes the neophyte “a new creature,” an 
adopted son of God, who has become a “partaker of the divine nature,”^ member of Christ and co¬ 
heir with him,^0 and a temple of the Holy Spirit.^ (505, 460 1 

1266 The Most Holy Trinity gives the baptized sanctifying grace, the grace of justification: (1992, 
1812 . 1831 . 1810 1 

—enabling them to believe in God, to hope in him, and to love him through the theological 
virtues; 

—giving them the power to live and act under the prompting of the Holy Spirit through the 

















gifts of the Holy Spirit; 

—allowing them to grow in goodness through the moral virtues. 

Thus the whole organism of the Christian’s supernatural life has its roots in Baptism. 
Incorporated into the Church, the Body of Christ 

1267 Baptism makes us members of the Body of Christ: “Therefore... we are members one of 
another.”-' Baptism incorporates us into the Church. From the baptismal fonts is born the one 
People of God of the New Covenant, which transcends all the natural or human limits of nations, 
cultures, races, and sexes: “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.”^ 1 782 1 

1268 The baptized have become “living stones” to be “built into a spiritual house, to be a holy 
priesthood.”^ By Baptism they share in the priesthood of Christ, in his prophetic and royal 
mission. They are “a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, that [they] 
may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called [them] out of darkness into his marvelous 
light.”^ Baptism gives a share in the common priesthood of all believers. ( 1141 . 784 1 

1269 Having become a member of the Church, the person baptized belongs no longer to himself, 
but to him who died and rose for us. ^ From now on, he is called to be subject to others, to serve 
them in the communion of the Church, and to “obey and submit” to the Church’s leaders,^ holding 
them in respect and affection.^ Just as Baptism is the source of responsibilities and duties, the 
baptized person also enjoys rights within the Church: to receive the sacraments, to be nourished 
with the Word of God and to be sustained by the other spiritual helps of the Church.22 [ 871 1 

1270 “Reborn as sons of God, [the baptized] must profess before men the faith they have received 
from God through the Church” and participate in the apostolic and missionary activity of the 
People of God.^ 

The sacramental bond of the unity of Christians 

1271 Baptism constitutes the foundation of communion among all Christians, including those who 
are not yet in full communion with the Catholic Church: “For men who believe in Christ and have 
been properly baptized are put in some, though imperfect, communion with the Catholic Church. 
Justified by faith in Baptism, [they] are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be 
called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers by the children of the Catholic 
Church.”£i “Baptism therefore constitutes the sacramental bond of unity existing among all who 






through it are reborn.”^ 


An indelible spiritual mark... 

1272 Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is configured to Christ. Baptism 
seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark ( character ) of his belonging to Christ. No sin 
can erase this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation.^ Given once 
for all, Baptism cannot be repeated. 

1273 Incorporated into the Church by Baptism, the faithful have received the sacramental character 
that consecrates them for Christian religious worship.^ The baptismal seal enables and commits 
Christians to serve God by a vital participation in the holy liturgy of the Church and to exercise 
their baptismal priesthood by the witness of holy lives and practical charity.^ 

1274 The Holy Spirit has marked us with the seal of the Lord (“Dominicus character ”) “for the 
day of redemption.”^ “Baptism indeed is the seal of eternal life.”^Z The faithful Christian who has 
“kept the seal” until the end, remaining faithful to the demands of his Baptism, will be able to 
depart this life “marked with the sign of faith, with his baptismal faith, in expectation of the 
blessed vision of God—the consummation of faith—and in the hope of resurrection. 1 197 . 2016 1 


IN BRIEF 

1275 Christian initiation is accomplished by three sacraments together: Baptism which is the 
beginning of new life; Confirmation which is its strengthening; and the Eucharist which nourishes 
the disciple with Christ’s Body and Blood for his transformation in Christ. 

1276 “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and 
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you” (Mt 
28:19-20). 

1277 Baptism is birth into the new life in Christ. In accordance with the Lord’s will, it is necessary 
for salvation, as is the Church herself, which we enter by Baptism. 

1278 The essential rite of Baptism consists in immersing the candidate in water or pouring water on 
his head, while pronouncing the invocation of the Most Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the 
Holy Spirit. 






1279 The fruit of Baptism, or baptismal grace, is a rich reality that includes forgiveness of original 
sin and all personal sins, birth into the new life by which man becomes an adoptive son of the 
Father, a member of Christ and a temple of the Holy Spirit. By this very fact the person baptized is 
incorporated into the Church, the Body of Christ, and made a sharer in the priesthood of Christ. 

1280 Baptism imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual sign, the character, which consecrates the 
baptized person for Christian worship. Because of the character Baptism cannot be repeated (cf. DS 
1609 and DS 1624). 

1281 Those who die for the faith, those who are catechumens, and all those who, without knowing 
of the Church but acting under the inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his 
will, can be saved even if they have not been baptized (cf. LG 16). 

1282 Since the earliest times, Baptism has been administered to children, for it is a grace and a gift 
of God that does not presuppose any human merit; children are baptized in the faith of the Church. 
Entry into Christian life gives access to true freedom. 

1283 With respect to children who have died without Baptism, the liturgy of the Church invites us 
to trust in God’s mercy and to pray for their salvation. 

1284 In case of necessity, any person can baptize provided that he have the intention of doing that 
which the Church does and provided that he pours water on the candidate’s head while saying: “I 
baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” 


ARTICLE 2 

THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION 


1285 Baptism, the Eucharist, and the sacrament of Confirmation together constitute the 
“sacraments of Christian initiation,” whose unity must be safeguarded. It must be explained to the 
faithful that the reception of the sacrament of Confirmation is necessary for the completion of 
baptismal graced For “by the sacrament of Confirmation, [the baptized] are more perfectly bound 
to the Church and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. Hence they are, as true 
witnesses of Christ, more strictly obliged to spread and defend the faith by word and deed.”2Q 


I. Confirmation in the Economy of Salvation 







1286 In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the Spirit of the Lord would rest on the 
hoped-for Messiah for his saving mission.^ The descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at his baptism 
by John was the sign that this was he who was to come, the Messiah, the Son of God.22 He was 
conceived of the Holy Spirit; his whole life and his whole mission are carried out in total 
communion with the Holy Spirit whom the Father gives him “without measure. ”23 1 702-716 1 

1287 This fullness of the Spirit was not to remain uniquely the Messiah’s, but was to be 
communicated to the whole messianic people .24 On several occasions Christ promised this 
outpouring of the Spirit, 22 a promise which he fulfilled first on Easter Sunday and then more 
strikingly at Pentecost .22 Filled with the Holy Spirit the apostles began to proclaim “the mighty 
works of God,” and Peter declared this outpouring of the Spirit to be the sign of the messianic 
age .22 Those who believed in the apostolic preaching and were baptized received the gift of the 
Holy Spirit in their turn.23 ( 739 1 

1288 “From that time on the apostles, in fulfillment of Christ’s will, imparted to the newly baptized 
by the laying on of hands the gift of the Spirit that completes the grace of Baptism. For this reason 
in the Letter to the Hebrews the doctrine concerning Baptism and the laying on of hands is listed 
among the first elements of Christian instruction. The imposition of hands is rightly recognized by 
the Catholic tradition as the origin of the sacrament of Confirmation, which in a certain way 
perpetuates the grace of Pentecost in the Church. ”22 1 699 1 

1289 Very early, the better to signify the gift of the Holy Spirit, an anointing with perfumed oil 
(chrism) was added to the laying on of hands. This anointing highlights the name “Christian,” 
which means “anointed” and derives from that of Christ himself whom God “anointed with the 
Holy Spirit.”122 This rite of anointing has continued ever since, in both East and West. For this 
reason the Eastern Churches call this sacrament Chrismation, anointing with chrism, or myron 
which means “chrism.” In the West, the term Confirmation suggests that this sacrament both 
confirms baptism and strengthens baptismal grace. 1 695 . 436 . 1297 1 

Two traditions: East and West 

1290 In the first centuries Confirmation generally comprised one single celebration with Baptism, 
forming with it a “double sacrament,” according to the expression of St. Cyprian. Among other 
reasons, the multiplication of infant baptisms all through the year, the increase of rural parishes, 
and the growth of dioceses often prevented the bishop from being present at all baptismal 
celebrations. In the West the desire to reserve the completion of Baptism to the bishop caused the 








temporal separation of the two sacraments. The East has kept them united, so that Confirmation is 
conferred by the priest who baptizes. But he can do so only with the “myron” consecrated by a 
bishop.121 ( 1233 1 

1291 A custom of the Roman Church facilitated the development of the Western practice: a double 
anointing with sacred chrism after Baptism. The first anointing of the neophyte on coming out of 
the baptismal bath was performed by the priest; it was completed by a second anointing on the 
forehead of the newly baptized by the bishop. — The first anointing with sacred chrism, by the 
priest, has remained attached to the baptismal rite; it signifies the participation of the one baptized 
in the prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices of Christ. If Baptism is conferred on an adult, there is 
only one post-baptismal anointing, that of Confirmation. ( 1242 1 

1292 The practice of the Eastern Churches gives greater emphasis to the unity of Christian 
initiation. That of the Latin Church more clearly expresses the communion of the new Christian 
with the bishop as guarantor and servant of the unity, catholicity and apostolicity of his Church, and 
hence the connection with the apostolic origins of Christ’s Church. 1 1244 1 

II. The Signs and the Rite of Confirmation 

1293 In treating the rite of Confirmation, it is fitting to consider the sign of anointing and what it 
signifies and imprints: a spiritual seal. 1 695 1 

Anointing, in Biblical and other ancient symbolism, is rich in meaning: oil is a sign of 
abundance and joy; 123 it cleanses (anointing before and after a bath) and limbers (the anointing of 
athletes and wrestlers); oil is a sign of healing, since it is soothing to bruises and wounds;122 and it 
makes radiant with beauty, health, and strength. 

1294 Anointing with oil has all these meanings in the sacramental life. The pre-baptismal anointing 
with the oil of catechumens signifies cleansing and strengthening; the anointing of the sick 
expresses healing and comfort. The post-baptismal anointing with sacred chrism in Confirmation 
and ordination is the sign of consecration. By Confirmation Christians, that is, those who are 
anointed, share more completely in the mission of Jesus Christ and the fullness of the Holy Spirit 
with which he is filled, so that their lives may give off “the aroma of Christ.”122 ( 1152 1 

1295 By this anointing the confirmand receives the “mark,” the seal of the Holy Spirit. A seal is a 
symbol of a person, a sign of personal authority, or ownership of an object.— Hence soldiers were 
marked with their leader’s seal and slaves with their master’s. A seal authenticates a juridical act or 







document and occasionally makes it secret.^ (698) 


1296 Christ himself declared that he was marked with his Father’s seal.l^ Christians are also 
marked with a seal: “It is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned us; he 
has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.”^ This seal of the Holy 
Spirit marks our total belonging to Christ, our enrollment in his service for ever, as well as the 
promise of divine protection in the great eschatological trial.HQ (1121) 

The celebration of Confirmation 

1297 The consecration of the sacred chrism is an important action that precedes the 
Confirmation, but is in a certain way a part of it. It is the bishop who, in the course 
Mass of Holy Thursday, consecrates the sacred chrism for his whole diocese. In 
Churches this consecration is even reserved to the patriarch: 1 1183 . 1241 1 

The liturgy of Antioch expresses the epiclesis for the consecration of the sacred chrism 
(myron) in this way: “[Father... send your Holy Spirit] on us and on this oil which is before us 
and consecrate it, so that it may be for all who are anointed and marked with it holy myron, 
priestly myron, royal myron, anointing with gladness, clothing with light, a cloak of salvation, 
a spiritual gift, the sanctification of souls and bodies, imperishable happiness, the indelible 
seal, a buckler of faith, and a fearsome helmet against all the works of the adversary.” 

1298 When Confirmation is celebrated separately from Baptism, as is the case in the Roman Rite, 
the Liturgy of Confirmation begins with the renewal of baptismal promises and the profession of 
faith by the confirmands. This clearly shows that Confirmation follows Baptism. HI When adults 
are baptized, they immediately receive Confirmation and participate in the Eucharist.^ 

1299 In the Roman Rite the bishop extends his hands over the whole group of the confirmands. 
Since the time of the apostles this gesture has signified the gift of the Spirit. The bishop invokes the 
outpouring of the Spirit in these words: ( 1831 ) 

All-powerful God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

by water and the Holy Spirit 

you freed your sons and daughters from sin 

and gave them new life. Send your Holy Spirit upon them 

to be their helper and guide. Give them the spirit of wisdom and understanding, 

the spirit of right judgment and courage, 


celebration of 
of the Chrism 
some Eastern 







the spirit of knowledge and reverence. 

Fill them with the spirit of wonder and awe in your presence. 

We ask this through Christ our Lord.li^ 

1300 The essential rite of the sacrament follows. In the Latin rite, “the sacrament of Confirmation 
is conferred through the anointing with chrism on the forehead, which is done by the laying on of 
the hand, and through the words: ‘Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti’ [Be sealed with the Gift 
of the Holy Spirit.].i n the Eastern Churches of Byzantine rite, after a prayer of epiclesis, the 
more significant parts of the body are anointed with myron: forehead, eyes, nose, ears, lips, chest, 
back, hands, and feet. Each anointing is accompanied by the formula 2cppqyc nvBupaToc 'Ayion 
(Signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti ): “the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit.”^ 1 699 ] 

1301 The sign of peace that concludes the rite of the sacrament signifies and demonstrates ecclesial 
communion with the bishop and with all the faithful. 116 

III. The Effects of Confirmation 

1302 It is evident from its celebration that the effect of the sacrament of Confirmation is the special 
outpouring of the Holy Spirit as once granted to the apostles on the day of Pentecost. 1 731 ] 

1303 From this fact, Confirmation brings an increase and deepening of baptismal grace: ( 1262- 
1274 . 2044 ] 

—it roots us more deeply in the divine filiation which makes us cry, “Abba! Father! 

—it unites us more firmly to Christ; 

—it increases the gifts of the Holy Spirit in us; 

—it renders our bond with the Church more perfect; 

—it gives us a special strength of the Holy Spirit to spread and defend the faith by word and 
action as true witnesses of Christ, to confess the name of Christ boldly, and never to be 
ashamed of the Cross ;119 

Recall then that you have received the spiritual seal, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, 
the spirit of right judgment and courage, the spirit of knowledge and reverence, the spirit of 
holy fear in God’s presence. Guard what you have received. God the Father has marked you 
with his sign; Christ the Lord has confirmed you and has placed his pledge, the Spirit, in your 
hearts.^ 









1304 Like Baptism which it completes, Confirmation is given only once, for it too imprints on the 
soul an indelible spiritual mark, the “character,” which is the sign that Jesus Christ has marked a 
Christian with the seal of his Spirit by clothing him with power from on high so that he may be his 
witness.!^ (1121 ) 

1305 This “character” perfects the common priesthood of the faithful, received in Baptism, and 
“the confirmed person receives the power to profess faith in Christ publicly and as it were officially 
(quasi ex officio).”^ ( 1268 1

IV. Who Can Receive This Sacrament? 

1306 Every baptized person not yet confirmed can and should receive the sacrament of 
Confirmation.123 Since Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist form a unity, it follows that “the 
faithful are obliged to receive this sacrament at the appropriate time, ”124 for without Confirmation 
and Eucharist, Baptism is certainly valid and efficacious, but Christian initiation remains 
incomplete. 1 1212 1 

1307 For centuries, Latin custom has indicated “the age of discretion” as the reference point for 
receiving Confirmation. But in danger of death children should be confirmed even if they have not 
yet attained the age of discretion.122 

1308 Although Confirmation is sometimes called the “sacrament of Christian maturity,” we must 
not confuse adult faith with the adult age of natural growth, nor forget that the baptismal grace is a 
grace of free, unmerited election and does not need “ratification” to become effective. St. Thomas 
reminds us of this: ( 1250 ) 


Age of body does not determine age of soul. Even in childhood man can attain spiritual 




maturity: as the book of Wisdom says: “For old age is not honored for length of time, or 
measured by number of years.” Many children, through the strength of the Holy Spirit they 
have received, have bravely fought for Christ even to the shedding of their blood.l^ 

1309 Preparation for Confirmation should aim at leading the Christian toward a more intimate 
union with Christ and a more lively familiarity with the Holy Spirit—his actions, his gifts, and his 
biddings—in order to be more capable of assuming the apostolic responsibilities of Christian life. 
To this end catechesis for Confirmation should strive to awaken a sense of belonging to the Church 
of Jesus Christ, the universal Church as well as the parish community. The latter bears special 
responsibility for the preparation of confirmands.122 

1310 To receive Confirmation one must be in a state of grace. One should receive the sacrament of 
Penance in order to be cleansed for the gift of the Holy Spirit. More intense prayer should prepare 
one to receive the strength and graces of the Holy Spirit with docility and readiness to act.i^ 
1 2670 1 

1311 Candidates for Confirmation, as for Baptism, fittingly seek the spiritual help of a sponsor. To 
emphasize the unity of the two sacraments, it is appropriate that this be one of the baptismal 
godparents.!^ (1255) 

V. The Minister of Confirmation 

1312 The original minister of Confirmation is the bishop.J^Q ( 1233 1 

In the East, ordinarily the priest who baptizes also immediately confers Confirmation in one 
and the same celebration. But he does so with sacred chrism consecrated by the patriarch or the 
bishop, thus expressing the apostolic unity of the Church whose bonds are strengthened by the 
sacrament of Confirmation. In the Latin Church, the same discipline applies to the Baptism of 
adults or to the reception into full communion with the Church of a person baptized in another 
Christian community that does not have valid Confirmation.!^! 

1313 In the Latin Rite, the ordinary minister of Confirmation is the bishop. 122 If the need arises, the 
bishop may grant the faculty of administering Confirmation!^ to priests, although it is fitting that 
he confer it himself, mindful that the celebration of Confirmation has been temporally separated 
from Baptism for this reason. Bishops are the successors of the apostles. They have received the 
fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders. The administration of this sacrament by them 
demonstrates clearly that its effect is to unite those who receive it more closely to the Church, to 





her apostolic origins, and to her mission of bearing witness to Christ. (1290, 1285 1 


1314 If a Christian is in danger of death, any priest can give him Confirmation.^ Indeed the 
Church desires that none of her children, even the youngest, should depart this world without 
having been perfected by the Holy Spirit with the gift of Christ’s fullness. ( 1307 ) 


IN BRIEF 

1315 “Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they 
sent to them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy 
Spirit; for it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the 
Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit” ( Acts 8:14-17). 

1316 Confirmation perfects Baptismal grace; it is the sacrament which gives the Holy Spirit in 
order to root us more deeply in the divine filiation, incorporate us more firmly into Christ, 
strengthen our bond with the Church, associate us more closely with her mission, and help us bear 
witness to the Christian faith in words accompanied by deeds. 

1317 Confirmation, like Baptism, imprints a spiritual mark or indelible character on the Christian’s 
soul; for this reason one can receive this sacrament only once in one’s life. 

1318 In the East this sacrament is administered immediately after Baptism and is followed by 
participation in the Eucharist; this tradition highlights the unity of the three sacraments of Christian 
initiation. In the Latin Church this sacrament is administered when the age of reason has been 
reached, and its celebration is ordinarily reserved to the bishop, thus signifying that this sacrament 
strengthens the ecclesial bond. 

1319 A candidate for Confirmation who has attained the age of reason must profess the faith, be in 
the state of grace, have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to assume the role 
of disciple and witness to Christ, both within the ecclesial community and in temporal affairs. 

1320 The essential rite of Confirmation is anointing the forehead of the baptized with sacred chrism 
(in the East other sense-organs as well), together with the laying on of the minister’s hand and the 
words: “Accipe signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti” (Be sealed with the Gift of the Holy Spirit.) in the 
Roman rite, or: Signaculum doni Spiritus Sancti (the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit) in the 
Byzantine rite. 









1321 When Confirmation is celebrated separately from Baptism, its connection with Baptism is 
expressed, among other ways, by the renewal of baptismal promises. The celebration of 
Confirmation during the Eucharist helps underline the unity of the sacraments of Christian 
initiation. 


ARTICLE 3 

THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST 


1322 The holy Eucharist completes Christian initiation. Those who have been raised to the dignity 
of the royal priesthood by Baptism and configured more deeply to Christ by Confirmation 
participate with the whole community in the Lord’s own sacrifice by means of the Eucharist. 
( 1212 ) 

1323 “At the Last Supper, on the night he was betrayed, our Savior instituted the Eucharistic 
sacrifice of his Body and Blood. This he did in order to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross 
throughout the ages until he should come again, and so to entrust to his beloved Spouse, the 
Church, a memorial of his death and resurrection: a sacrament of love, a sign of unity, a bond of 
charity, a Paschal banquet ‘in which Christ is consumed, the mind is filled with grace, and a pledge 
of future glory is given to us.’”^ (1402 ) 

I. The Eucharist—Source and Summit of Ecclesial Life 

1324 The Eucharist is “the source and summit of the Christian life.”12§ “The other sacraments, and 
indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and 
are oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the whole spiritual good of the 
Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch.”i^ 1 864 1 

1325 “The Eucharist is the efficacious sign and sublime cause of that communion in the divine life 
and that unity of the People of God by which the Church is kept in being. It is the culmination both 
of God’s action sanctifying the world in Christ and of the worship men offer to Christ and through 
him to the Father in the Holy Spirit.”^ 1 775 1 

1326 Finally, by the Eucharistic celebration we already unite ourselves with the heavenly liturgy 
and anticipate eternal life, when God will be all in all.l^ 1 1090 1 


1327 In brief, the Eucharist is the sum and summary of our faith: “Our way of thinking is attuned to 











the Eucharist, and the Eucharist in turn confirms our way of thinking.”!^ (1124) 

II. What Is This Sacrament Called? 

1328 The inexhaustible richness of this sacrament is expressed in the different names we give it. 
Each name evokes certain aspects of it. It is called: ( 2637 . 1082 . 1359 1 

Eucharist, because it is an action of thanksgiving to God. The Greek words eucharistein 
and eulogein 142 recall the Jewish blessings that proclaim—especially during a meal—God’s works: 
creation, redemption, and sanctification. 

1329 The Lord’s Supper, because of its connection with the supper which the Lord took with his 
disciples on the eve of his Passion and because it anticipates the wedding feast of the Lamb in the 
heavenly Jerusalem.!^ ( 1382 . 790 . 1348 1 

The Breaking of Bread, because Jesus used this rite, part of a Jewish meal, when as master of 
the table he blessed and distributed the bread,above all at the Last Supper.l^ It is by this action 
that his disciples will recognize him after his Resurrection,^ anc [ it is this expression that the first 
Christians will use to designate their Eucharistic assemblies;^ by doing so they signified that all 
who eat the one broken bread, Christ, enter into communion with him and form but one body in 

him.MB 

The Eucharistic assembly (synaxis ), because the Eucharist is celebrated amid the assembly of 
the faithful, the visible expression of the Church.149 

1330 The memorial of the Lord’s Passion and Resurrection. 1 1341 . 614 . 2643 . 1169 1 

The Holy Sacrifice, because it makes present the one sacrifice of Christ the Savior and 
includes the Church’s offering. The terms holy sacrifice of the Mass, “sacrifice of praise,” spiritual 
sacrifice, pure and holy sacrifice are also used,l^ since it completes and surpasses all the sacrifices 
of the Old Covenant. 

The Holy and Divine Liturgy, because the Church’s whole liturgy finds its center and most 
intense expression in the celebration of this sacrament; in the same sense we also call its celebration 
the Sacred Mysteries. We speak of the Most Blessed Sacrament because it is the Sacrament of 
sacraments. The Eucharistic species reserved in the tabernacle are designated by this same name. 

1331 Holy Communion, because by this sacrament we unite ourselves to Christ, who makes us 
sharers in his Body and Blood to form a single body.i^i We also call it: the holy things (ta hagia; 
sancta)^ — the first meaning of the phrase “communion of saints” in the Apostles’ Creed— the 
bread of angels, bread from heaven, medicine of immortality,^ viaticum.... (950, 948, 1405 1 

















1332 Holy Mass (Missa), because the liturgy in which the mystery of salvation is accomplished 
concludes with the sending forth ( missio ) of the faithful, so that they may fulfill God’s will in their 
daily lives. (M2) 

III. The Eucharist in the Economy of Salvation 

The signs of bread and wine 

1333 At the heart of the Eucharistic celebration are the bread and wine that, by the words of Christ 
and the invocation of the Holy Spirit, become Christ’s Body and Blood. Faithful to the Lord’s 
command the Church continues to do, in his memory and until his glorious return, what he did on 
the eve of his Passion: “He took bread....” “He took the cup filled with wine....” The signs of bread 
and wine become, in a way surpassing understanding, the Body and Blood of Christ; they continue 
also to signify the goodness of creation. Thus in the Offertory we give thanks to the Creator for 
bread and wine,i^d fruit of the “work of human hands,” but above all as “fruit of the earth” and “of 
the vine” — gifts of the Creator. The Church sees in the gesture of the king-priest Melchizedek, 
who “brought out bread and wine,” a prefiguring of her own offering.!^ ( 1350 . 1147 . 1148 1 

1334 In the Old Covenant bread and wine were offered in sacrifice among the first fruits of the 
earth as a sign of grateful acknowledgment to the Creator. But they also received a new 
significance in the context of the Exodus: the unleavened bread that Israel eats every year at 
Passover commemorates the haste of the departure that liberated them from Egypt; the 
remembrance of the manna in the desert will always recall to Israel that it lives by the bread of the 
Word of God;l^ their daily bread is the fruit of the promised land, the pledge of God’s faithfulness 
to his promises. The “cup of blessing”^ at the end of the Jewish Passover meal adds to the festive 
joy of wine an eschatological dimension: the messianic expectation of the rebuilding of Jerusalem. 
When Jesus instituted the Eucharist, he gave a new and definitive meaning to the blessing of the 
bread and the cup. ( 1150 . 1363 1 

1335 The miracles of the multiplication of the loaves, when the Lord says the blessing, breaks and 
distributes the loaves through his disciples to feed the multitude, prefigure the superabundance of 
this unique bread of his Eucharist.l^ The sign of water turned into wine at Cana already announces 
the Hour of Jesus’ glorification. It makes manifest the fulfillment of the wedding feast in the 
Father’s kingdom, where the faithful will drink the new wine that has become the Blood of 
Christ.— ( 1151 1 









1336 The first announcement of the Eucharist divided the disciples, just as the announcement of the 
Passion scandalized them: “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?”l§0 The Eucharist and the 
Cross are stumbling blocks. It is the same mystery and it never ceases to be an occasion of division. 
“Will you also go away?”:^ the Lord’s question echoes through the ages, as a loving invitation to 
discover that only he has “the words of eternal life”ih2 an g that to receive in faith the gift of his 
Eucharist is to receive the Lord himself (1327) 

The institution of the Eucharist 

1337 The Lord, having loved those who were his own, loved them to the end. Knowing that the 
hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father, in the course of a meal he washed their 
feet and gave them the commandment of love.lh^ i n order to leave them a pledge of this love, in 
order never to depart from his own and to make them sharers in his Passover, he instituted the 
Eucharist as the memorial of his death and Resurrection, and commanded his apostles to celebrate 
it until his return; “thereby he constituted them priests of the New Testament.”^ (610, 611 1 

1338 The three synoptic Gospels and St. Paul have handed on to us the account of the institution of 
the Eucharist; St. John, for his part, reports the words of Jesus in the synagogue of Capernaum that 
prepare for the institution of the Eucharist: Christ calls himself the bread of life, come down from 

heaven.dhS 


1339 Jesus chose the time of Passover to fulfill what he had announced at Capernaum: giving his 
disciples his Body and his Blood: ( 1169 1 

Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed. So 
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the passover meal for us, that we may eat 
it....” They went... and prepared the passover. And when the hour came, he sat at table, and the 
apostles with him. And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you 
before I suffer; for I tell you I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of 
God..”... And he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them, 
saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” And 
likewise the cup after supper, saying, “This cup which is poured out for you is the New 
Covenant in my blood.”!^ 

1340 By celebrating the Last Supper with his apostles in the course of the Passover meal, Jesus 
gave the Jewish Passover its definitive meaning. Jesus’ passing over to his father by his death and 
Resurrection, the new Passover, is anticipated in the Supper and celebrated in the Eucharist, which 






fulfills the Jewish Passover and anticipates the final Passover of the Church in the glory of the 
kingdom. ( 1151 . 677) 


“Do this in memory of me” 

1341 The command of Jesus to repeat his actions and words “until he comes” does not only ask us 
to remember Jesus and what he did. It is directed at the liturgical celebration, by the apostles and 
their successors, of the memorial of Christ, of his life, of his death, of his Resurrection, and of his 
intercession in the presence of the Father.ihZ ( 611 . 1363 1 

1342 From the beginning the Church has been faithful to the Lord’s command. Of the Church of 
Jerusalem it is written: (2624) 

They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread 
and the prayers.... Day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their 
homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts.^ 

1343 It was above all on “the first day of the week,” Sunday, the day of Jesus’ resurrection, that the 
Christians met “to break bread.”ih2 From that time on down to our own day the celebration of the 
Eucharist has been continued so that today we encounter it everywhere in the Church with the same 
fundamental structure. It remains the center of the Church’s life. ( 1166 . 2177 1 

1344 Thus from celebration to celebration, as they proclaim the Paschal mystery of Jesus “until he 
comes,” the pilgrim People of God advances, “following the narrow way of the cross, ”122 toward 
the heavenly banquet, when all the elect will be seated at the table of the kingdom. ( 1404 ) 

IV. The Liturgical Celebration of the Eucharist 

The Mass of all ages 

1345 As early as the second century we have the witness of St. Justin Martyr for the basic lines of 
the order of the Eucharistic celebration. They have stayed the same until our own day for all the 
great liturgical families. St. Justin wrote to the pagan emperor Antoninus Pius (138-161) around the 
year 155, explaining what Christians did: 

On the day we call the day of the sun, all who dwell in the city or country gather in the same 
place. 










The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets are read, as much as time 
permits. 

When the reader has finished, he who presides over those gathered admonishes and 
challenges them to imitate these beautiful things. 

Then we all rise together and offer prayers* for ourselves... and for all others, wherever 
they may be, so that we may be found righteous by our life and actions, and faithful to the 
commandments, so as to obtain eternal salvation. 

When the prayers are concluded we exchange the kiss. 

Then someone brings bread and a cup of water and wine mixed together to him who 
presides over the brethren. 

He takes them and offers praise and glory to the Father of the universe, through the name 
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and for a considerable time he gives thanks (in Greek: 
eucharistian ) that we have been judged worthy of these gifts. 

When he has concluded the prayers and thanksgivings, all present give voice to an 
acclamation by saying: ‘Amen.’ 

When he who presides has given thanks and the people have responded, those whom we 
call deacons give to those present the “eucharisted” bread, wine and water and take them to 
those who are absent.Hl 

1346 The liturgy of the Eucharist unfolds according to a fundamental structure which has been 
preserved throughout the centuries down to our own day. It displays two great parts that form a 
fundamental unity: ( 103 ) 

-the gathering, the liturgy of the Word, with readings, homily, and general intercessions; 

-the liturgy of the Eucharist, with the presentation of the bread and wine, the consecratory 
thanksgiving, and communion. 

The liturgy of the Word and liturgy of the Eucharist together form “one single act of 
worship”;H the Eucharistic table set for us is the table both of the Word of God and of the Body 

of the Lord.H 

1347 Is this not the same movement as the Paschal meal of the risen Jesus with his disciples? 
Walking with them he explained the Scriptures to them; sitting with them at table “he took bread, 
blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.”H 


The movement of the celebration 



1348 All gather together. Christians come together in one place for the Eucharistic assembly. At its 
head is Christ himself, the principal agent of the Eucharist. He is high priest of the New Covenant; 
it is he himself who presides invisibly over every Eucharistic celebration. It is in representing him 
that the bishop or priest acting in the person of Christ the head (in persona Christi capitis ) presides 
over the assembly, speaks after the readings, receives the offerings, and says the Eucharistic Prayer. 
All have their own active parts to play in the celebration, each in his own way: readers, those who 
bring up the offerings, those who give communion, and the whole people whose “Amen” manifests 
their participation. ( 1140 . 1548 1 

1349 The Liturgy of the Word includes “the writings of the prophets,” that is, the Old Testament, 
and “the memoirs of the apostles” (their letters and the Gospels). After the homily, which is an 
exhortation to accept this Word as what it truly is, the Word of God,125 and to put it into practice, 
come the intercessions for all men, according to the Apostle’s words: “I urge that supplications, 
prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings, and all who are in high 
positions. ”126 (1184) 

1350 The presentation of the offerings (the Offertory). Then, sometimes in procession, the bread 
and wine are brought to the altar; they will be offered by the priest in the name of Christ in the 
Eucharistic sacrifice in which they will become his body and blood. It is the very action of Christ at 
the Last Supper — “taking the bread and a cup.” “The Church alone offers this pure oblation to the 
Creator, when she offers what comes forth from his creation with thanksgiving.”122 The 
presentation of the offerings at the altar takes up the gesture of Melchizedek and commits the 
Creator’s gifts into the hands of Christ who, in his sacrifice, brings to perfection all human attempts 
to offer sacrifices. ( 1359 . 614 1 

1351 From the very beginning Christians have brought, along with the bread and wine for the 
Eucharist, gifts to share with those in need. This custom of the collection, ever appropriate, is 
inspired by the example of Christ who became poor to make us rich;126 ( 1397 . 2186 1 

Those who are well off, and who are also willing, give as each chooses. What is gathered is 
given to him who presides to assist orphans and widows, those whom illness or any other 
cause has deprived of resources, prisoners, immigrants and, in a word, all who are in need.— 

1352 The anaphora: with the Eucharistic Prayer—the prayer of thanksgiving and consecration— 
we come to the heart and summit of the celebration: ( 559 1 

In the preface, the Church gives thanks to the Father, through Christ, in the Holy Spirit, for all 










his works: creation, redemption, and sanctification. The whole community thus joins in the 
unending praise that the Church in heaven, the angels and all the saints, sing to the thrice-holy God. 

1353 In the epiclesis, the Church asks the Father to send his Holy Spirit (or the power of his 
blessingl^) on the bread and wine, so that by his power they may become the body and blood of 
Jesus Christ and so that those who take part in the Eucharist may be one body and one spirit (some 
liturgical traditions put the epiclesis after the anamnesis). ( 1105 . 1375 1 

In the institution narrative, the power of the words and the action of Christ, and the power of 
the Holy Spirit, make sacramentally present under the species of bread and wine Christ’s body and 
blood, his sacrifice offered on the cross once for all. 

1354 In the anamnesis that follows, the Church calls to mind the Passion, resurrection, and glorious 
return of Christ Jesus; she presents to the Father the offering of his Son which reconciles us with 
him. ( 954 1 

In the intercessions, the Church indicates that the Eucharist is celebrated in communion with 
the whole Church in heaven and on earth, the living and the dead, and in communion with the 
pastors of the Church, the Pope, the diocesan bishop, his presbyterium and his deacons, and all the 
bishops of the whole world together with their Churches. 

1355 In the communion, preceded by the Lord’s prayer and the breaking of the bread, the faithful 
receive “the bread of heaven” and “the cup of salvation,” the body and blood of Christ who offered 
himself “for the life of the world”:^ ( 1327 1 

Because this bread and wine have been made Eucharist (“eucharisted,” according to an ancient 
expression), “we call this food Eucharist, and no one may take part in it unless he believes that 
what we teach is true, has received baptism for the forgiveness of sins and new birth, and lives 
in keeping with what Christ taught.”122 

V. The Sacramental Sacrifice: Thanksgiving, Memorial, Presence 

1356 If from the beginning Christians have celebrated the Eucharist and in a form whose substance 
has not changed despite the great diversity of times and liturgies, it is because we know ourselves 
to be bound by the command the Lord gave on the eve of his Passion: “Do this in remembrance of 


1357 We carry out this command of the Lord by celebrating the memorial of his sacrifice. In so 
doing, we offer to the Father what he has himself given us: the gifts of his creation, bread and wine 






which, by the power of the Holy Spirit and by the words of Christ, have become the body and 
blood of Christ. Christ is thus really and mysteriously made present 

1358 We must therefore consider the Eucharist as: 

-thanksgiving and praise to the Father; 

-the sacrificial memorial of Christ and his Body; 

-the presence of Christ by the power of his word and of his Spirit. 

Thanksgiving and praise to the Father 

1359 The Eucharist, the sacrament of our salvation accomplished by Christ on the cross, is also a 
sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for the work of creation. In the Eucharistic sacrifice the whole of 
creation loved by God is presented to the Father through the death and the Resurrection of Christ. 
Through Christ the Church can offer the sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for all that God has 
made good, beautiful, and just in creation and in humanity. (293) 

1360 The Eucharist is a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the Father, a blessing by which the Church 
expresses her gratitude to God for all his benefits, for all that he has accomplished through creation, 
redemption, and sanctification. Eucharist means first of all “thanksgiving.” ( 1083 ) 

1361 The Eucharist is also the sacrifice of praise by which the Church sings the glory of God in the 
name of all creation. This sacrifice of praise is possible only through Christ: he unites the faithful to 
his person, to his praise, and to his intercession, so that the sacrifice of praise to the Father is 
offered through Christ and with him, to be accepted in him. ( 294 ) 

The sacrificial memorial of Christ and of his Body, the Church 

1362 The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ’s Passover, the making present and the sacramental 
offering of his unique sacrifice, in the liturgy of the Church which is his Body. In all the Eucharistic 
Prayers we find after the words of institution a prayer called the anamnesis or memorial. 1 1103 1 

1363 In the sense of Sacred Scripture the memorial is not merely the recollection of past events but 
the proclamation of the mighty works wrought by God for men.l^ i n the liturgical celebration of 
these events, they become in a certain way present and real. This is how Israel understands its 
liberation from Egypt: every time Passover is celebrated, the Exodus events are made present to the 
memory of believers so that they may conform their lives to them. (1099) 







1364 In the New Testament, the memorial takes on new meaning. When the Church celebrates the 
Eucharist, she commemorates Christ’s Passover, and it is made present: the sacrifice Christ offered 
once for all on the cross remains ever present.^ “As often as the sacrifice of the Cross by which 
‘Christ our Pasch has been sacrificed’ is celebrated on the altar, the work of our redemption is 
carried out.”12§ ( 611 . 1085 1 

1365 Because it is the memorial of Christ’s Passover, the Eucharist is also a sacrifice. The 
sacrificial character of the Eucharist is manifested in the very words of institution: “This is my 
body which is given for you” and “This cup which is poured out for you is the New Covenant in 
my blood. ”1^2 i n the Eucharist Christ gives us the very body which he gave up for us on the cross, 
the very blood which he “poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”l^ 1 2100 . 1846 1 

1366 The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice because it re-presents (makes present) the sacrifice of the 
cross, because it is its memorial and because it applies its fruit: 1 613 1 

[Christ], our Lord and God, was once and for all to offer himself to God the Father by his 
death on the altar of the cross, to accomplish there an everlasting redemption. But because his 
priesthood was not to end with his death, at the Last Supper “on the night when he was 
betrayed,” [he wanted] to leave to his beloved spouse the Church a visible sacrifice (as the 
nature of man demands) by which the bloody sacrifice which he was to accomplish once for 
all on the cross would be re-presented, its memory perpetuated until the end of the world, and 
its salutary power be applied to the forgiveness of the sins we daily commit. 1^9 

1367 The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice: “The victim 
is one and the same: the same now offers through the ministry of priests, who then offered himself 
on the cross; only the manner of offering is different.” “And since in this divine sacrifice which is 
celebrated in the Mass, the same Christ who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar 
of the cross is contained and offered in an unbloody manner... this sacrifice is truly 
propitiatory.”^ ( 1545 ) 

1368 The Eucharist is also the sacrifice of the Church. The Church which is the Body of Christ 
participates in the offering of her Head. With him, she herself is offered whole and entire. She 
unites herself to his intercession with the Father for all men. In the Eucharist the sacrifice of Christ 
becomes also the sacrifice of the members of his Body. The lives of the faithful, their praise, 
sufferings, prayer, and work, are united with those of Christ and with his total offering, and so 
acquire a new value. Christ’s sacrifice present on the altar makes it possible for all generations of 








Christians to be united with his offering. (618, 2031 . 1109 1 

In the catacombs the Church is often represented as a woman in prayer, arms outstretched in 
the praying position. Like Christ who stretched out his arms on the cross, through him, with him, 
and in him, she offers herself and intercedes for all men. 

1369 The whole Church is united with the offering and intercession of Christ. Since he has the 
ministry of Peter in the Church, the Pope is associated with every celebration of the Eucharist, 
wherein he is named as the sign and servant of the unity of the universal Church. The bishop of the 
place is always responsible for the Eucharist, even when a priest presides; the bishop’s name is 
mentioned to signify his presidency over the particular Church, in the midst of his presbyterium and 
with the assistance of deacons. The community intercedes also for all ministers who, for it and with 
it, offer the Eucharistic sacrifice: (834, 882, 1561 . 1566 1 

Let only that Eucharist be regarded as legitimate, which is celebrated under [the presidency of] 
the bishop or him to whom he has entrusted it.lSl 

Through the ministry of priests the spiritual sacrifice of the faithful is completed in union with 
the sacrifice of Christ the only Mediator, which in the Eucharist is offered through the priests’ 
hands in the name of the whole Church in an unbloody and sacramental manner until the Lord 
himself comes.1^2 

1370 To the offering of Christ are united not only the members still here on earth, but also those 
already in the glory of heaven. In communion with and commemorating the Blessed Virgin Mary 
and all the saints, the Church offers the Eucharistic sacrifice. In the Eucharist the Church is as it 
were at the foot of the cross with Mary, united with the offering and intercession of Christ. (956, 
969 1 

1371 The Eucharistic sacrifice is also offered for the faithful departed who “have died in Christ but 
are not yet wholly purified,”!^ so that they may be able to enter into the light and peace of Christ: 
1 958 . 1689 . 1032 1 

Put this body anywhere! Don’t trouble yourselves about it! I simply ask you to remember me 
at the Lord’s altar wherever you are.dM 

Then, we pray [in the anaphora] for the holy fathers and bishops who have fallen asleep, and 
in general for all who have fallen asleep before us, in the belief that it is a great benefit to the 
souls on whose behalf the supplication is offered, while the holy and tremendous Victim is 














present.... By offering to God our supplications for those who have fallen asleep, if they have 
sinned, we... offer Christ sacrificed for the sins of all, and so render favorable, for them and for 
us, the God who loves man.122 

1372 St. Augustine admirably summed up this doctrine that moves us to an ever more complete 
participation in our Redeemer’s sacrifice which we celebrate in the Eucharist: (1140) 

This wholly redeemed city, the assembly and society of the saints, is offered to God as a 
universal sacrifice by the high priest who in the form of a slave went so far as to offer himself 
for us in his Passion, to make us the Body of so great a head.... Such is the sacrifice of 
Christians: “we who are many are one Body in Christ. ,£ The Church continues to reproduce 
this sacrifice in the sacrament of the altar so well-known to believers wherein it is evident to 
them that in what she offers she herself is offered.122 

The presence of Christ by the power of his word and the Holy Spirit 

1373 “Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, 
who indeed intercedes for us,” is present in many ways to his Church;i2Z in his word, in his 
Church’s prayer, “where two or three are gathered in my name, ”122 in the poor, the sick, and the 
imprisoned,122 in the sacraments of which he is the author, in the sacrifice of the Mass, and in the 
person of the minister. But “he is present... most especially in the Eucharistic species .”222 (1088) 

1374 The mode of Christ’s presence under the Eucharistic species is unique. It raises the Eucharist 
above all the sacraments as “the perfection of the spiritual life and the end to which all the 
sacraments tend.”2El In the most blessed sacrament of the Eucharist “the body and blood, together 
with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ and, therefore, the whole Christ is truly, really, 
and substantially contained.”222 “This presence is called ‘real’—by which is not intended to 
exclude the other types of presence as if they could not be ‘real’ too, but because it is presence in 
the fullest sense: that is to say, it is a substantial presence by which Christ, God and man, makes 
himself wholly and entirely present.”223 ( 1211 ) 

1375 It is by the conversion of the bread and wine into Christ’s body and blood that Christ becomes 
present in this sacrament. The Church Fathers strongly affirmed the faith of the Church in the 
efficacy of the Word of Christ and of the action of the Holy Spirit to bring about this conversion. 
Thus St. John Chrysostom declares: ( 1105 . 1128 . 298 1 


It is not man that causes the things offered to become the Body and Blood of Christ, but he 








who was crucified for us, Christ himself. The priest, in the role of Christ, pronounces these 
words, but their power and grace are God’s. This is my body, he says. This word transforms 
the things offered.^ 

And St. Ambrose says about this conversion: 

Be convinced that this is not what nature has formed, but what the blessing has consecrated. 
The power of the blessing prevails over that of nature, because by the blessing nature itself is 
changed.... Could not Christ’s word, which can make from nothing what did not exist, change 
existing things into what they were not before? It is no less a feat to give things their original 
nature than to change their nature.^ 

1376 The Council of Trent summarizes the Catholic faith by declaring: “Because Christ our 
Redeemer said that it was truly his body that he was offering under the species of bread, it has 
always been the conviction of the Church of God, and this holy Council now declares again, that by 
the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the 
bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord and of the whole substance of the wine into 
the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called 
transubstantiation.”^ 

1377 The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment of the consecration and endures as 
long as the Eucharistic species subsist. Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and 
whole and entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the breaking of the bread does not divide 

Christ.^ 


1378 Worship of the Eucharist. In the liturgy of the Mass we express our faith in the real presence 
of Christ under the species of bread and wine by, among other ways, genuflecting or bowing deeply 
as a sign of adoration of the Lord. “The Catholic Church has always offered and still offers to the 
sacrament of the Eucharist the cult of adoration, not only during Mass, but also outside of it, 
reserving the consecrated hosts with the utmost care, exposing them to the solemn veneration of the 
faithful, and carrying them in procession.”^ (1178 . 103 . 2628 1 

1379 The tabernacle was first intended for the reservation of the Eucharist in a worthy place so that 
it could be brought to the sick and those absent, outside of Mass. As faith in the real presence of 
Christ in his Eucharist deepened, the Church became conscious of the meaning of silent adoration 
of the Lord present under the Eucharistic species. It is for this reason that the tabernacle should be 
located in an especially worthy place in the church and should be constructed in such a way that it 





emphasizes and manifests the truth of the real presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. ( 1183 . 
2691 1 

1380 It is highly fitting that Christ should have wanted to remain present to his Church in this 
unique way. Since Christ was about to take his departure from his own in his visible form, he 
wanted to give us his sacramental presence; since he was about to offer himself on the cross to save 
us, he wanted us to have the memorial of the love with which he loved us “to the end,”2S2 even to 
the giving of his life. In his Eucharistic presence he remains mysteriously in our midst as the one 
who loved us and gave himself up for us,21h and he remains under signs that express and 
communicate this love: 1 669 . 478 . 2715 1 

The Church and the world have a great need for Eucharistic worship. Jesus awaits us in this 
sacrament of love. Let us not refuse the time to go to meet him in adoration, in contemplation 
full of faith, and open to making amends for the serious offenses and crimes of the world. Let 
our adoration never cease.211 

1381 “That in this sacrament are the true Body of Christ and his true Blood is something that 
‘cannot be apprehended by the senses,’ says St. Thomas, ‘but only by faith, which relies on divine 
authority.’ For this reason, in a commentary on Luke 22:19 (‘This is my body which is given for 
you.’), St. Cyril says: ‘Do not doubt whether this is true, but rather receive the words of the Savior 
in faith, for since he is the truth, he cannot lie .’”212 (156, 215 1 

Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore 

Masked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more, 

See, Lord, at thy service low lies here a heart 
Lost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art. 

Seeing, touching, tasting are in thee deceived; 

How says trusty hearing? that shall be believed; 

What God’s Son has told me, take for truth I do; 

Truth himself speaks truly or there’s nothing true.

VI. The Paschal Banquet 

1382 The Mass is at the same time, and inseparably, the sacrificial memorial in which the sacrifice 
of the cross is perpetuated and the sacred banquet of communion with the Lord’s body and blood. 
But the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice is wholly directed toward the intimate union of the 
faithful with Christ through communion. To receive communion is to receive Christ himself who 
has offered himself for us. ( 950 1 

1383 The altar, around which the Church is gathered in the celebration of the Eucharist, represents 
the two aspects of the same mystery: the altar of the sacrifice and the table of the Lord. This is all 
the more so since the Christian altar is the symbol of Christ himself, present in the midst of the 
assembly of his faithful, both as the victim offered for our reconciliation and as food from heaven 
who is giving himself to us. “For what is the altar of Christ if not the image of the Body of 
Christ?”2H asks St. Ambrose. He says elsewhere, “The altar represents the body [of Christ] and the 
Body of Christ is on the altar. ”212 The liturgy expresses this unity of sacrifice and communion in 
many prayers. Thus the Roman Church prays in its anaphora: ( 1182 ) 


We entreat you, almighty God, 
that by the hands of your holy Angel 




this offering may be borne to your altar in heaven 

in the sight of your divine majesty, 

so that as we receive in communion at this altar 

the most holy Body and Blood of your Son, 

we may be filled with every heavenly blessing and grace. 24b 

“Take this and eat it, all of you”: communion 

1384 The Lord addresses an invitation to us, urging us to receive him in the sacrament of the 
Eucharist: “Truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you 
have no life in you.”417 (2835) 

1385 To respond to this invitation we must prepare ourselves for so great and so holy a moment. 
St. Paul urges us to examine our conscience: “Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup 
of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let 
a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. Lor any one who eats and 
drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. ”418 Anyone conscious 
of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion. ( 1457 1 

1386 Before so great a sacrament, the faithful can only echo humbly and with ardent faith the 
words of the Centurion: “Domine, non sum dignus ut intres sub tectum meum, sed tantum die 
verbo, et sanabitur anima mea” (“Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but 
only say the word and my soul will be healed.”).4H And in the Divine Liturgy of St. John 
Chrysostom the faithful pray in the same spirit: 1 732 1 

O Son of God, bring me into communion today with your mystical supper. I shall not tell your 
enemies the secret, nor kiss you with Judas’ kiss. But like the good thief I cry, “Jesus, 
remember me when you come into your kingdom.” 

1387 To prepare for worthy reception of this sacrament, the faithful should observe the fast 
required in their Church.Hl Bodily demeanor (gestures, clothing) ought to convey the respect, 
solemnity, and joy of this moment when Christ becomes our guest. 1 2043 1 

1388 It is in keeping with the very meaning of the Eucharist that the faithful, if they have the 
required dispositions,444 receive communion when they participate in the Mass.442 As the Second 
Vatican Council says: “That more perfect form of participation in the Mass whereby the faithful, 
after the priest’s communion, receive the Lord’s Body from the same sacrifice, is warmly 






recommended.”^ 


1389 The Church obliges the faithful to take part in the Divine Liturgy on Sundays and feast days 
and, prepared by the sacrament of Reconciliation, to receive the Eucharist at least once a year, if 
possible during the Easter season.224 gut the Church strongly encourages the faithful to receive the 
holy Eucharist on Sundays and feast days, or more often still, even daily. (2042, 2837 1 

1390 Since Christ is sacramentally present under each of the species, communion under the species 
of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. For pastoral reasons 
this manner of receiving communion has been legitimately established as the most common form in 
the Latin rite. But “the sign of communion is more complete when given under both kinds, since in 
that form the sign of the Eucharistic meal appears more clearly.”225 j]-,^ t j-, e usua i form of 
receiving communion in the Eastern rites. 

The fruits of Holy Communion 

1391 Holy Communion augments our union with Christ. The principal fruit of receiving the 
Eucharist in Holy Communion is an intimate union with Christ Jesus. Indeed, the Lord said: “He 
who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.”226 Life in Christ has its 
foundation in the Eucharistic banquet: “As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the 
Father, so he who eats me will live because of me.”222 (460, 521 1 

On the feasts of the Lord, when the faithful receive the Body of the Son, they proclaim to one 
another the Good News that the first fruits of life have been given, as when the angel said to 
Mary Magdalene, “Christ is risen!” Now too are life and resurrection conferred on whoever 
receives Christ.228 

1392 What material food produces in our bodily life, Holy Communion wonderfully achieves in 
our spiritual life. Communion with the flesh of the risen Christ, a flesh “given life and giving life 
through the Holy Spirit, ”221 preserves, increases, and renews the life of grace received at Baptism. 
This growth in Christian life needs the nourishment of Eucharistic Communion, the bread for our 
pilgrimage until the moment of death, when it will be given to us as viaticum. 1 1212 . 1524 1 

1393 Holy Communion separates us from sin. The body of Christ we receive in Holy Communion 
is “given up for us,” and the blood we drink “shed for the many for the forgiveness of sins.” For 
this reason the Eucharist cannot unite us to Christ without at the same time cleansing us from past 
sins and preserving us from future sins: 1 613 1 









For as often as we eat this bread and drink the cup, we proclaim the death of the Lord. If we 
proclaim the Lord’s death, we proclaim the forgiveness of sins. If, as often as his blood is 
poured out, it is poured for the forgiveness of sins, I should always receive it, so that it may 
always forgive my sins. Because I always sin, I should always have a remedy.— 

1394 As bodily nourishment restores lost strength, so the Eucharist strengthens our charity, which 
tends to be weakened in daily life; and this living charity wipes away venial sins.^21 By giving 
himself to us Christ revives our love and enables us to break our disordered attachments to 
creatures and root ourselves in him: ( 1863 . 1436 1 

Since Christ died for us out of love, when we celebrate the memorial of his death at the 
moment of sacrifice we ask that love may be granted to us by the coming of the Holy Spirit. 
We humbly pray that in the strength of this love by which Christ willed to die for us, we, by 
receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, may be able to consider the world as crucified for us, and 
to be ourselves as crucified to the world.... Having received the gift of love, let us die to sin 
and live for God.^2 

1395 By the same charity that it enkindles in us, the Eucharist preserves us from future mortal sins. 
The more we share the life of Christ and progress in his friendship, the more difficult it is to break 
away from him by mortal sin. The Eucharist is not ordered to the forgiveness of mortal sins—that is 
proper to the sacrament of Reconciliation. The Eucharist is properly the sacrament of those who are 
in full communion with the Church. ( 1855 . 1446 1 

1396 The unity of the Mystical Body: the Eucharist makes the Church. Those who receive the 
Eucharist are united more closely to Christ. Through it Christ unites them to all the faithful in one 
body—the Church. Communion renews, strengthens, and deepens this incorporation into the 
Church, already achieved by Baptism. In Baptism we have been called to form but one body.^33 
The Eucharist fulfills this call: “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the 
blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because 
there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread: (1118, 
1267 . 790 . 1064 1 

If you are the body and members of Christ, then it is your sacrament that is placed on the table 
of the Lord; it is your sacrament that you receive. To that which you are you respond “Amen” 
(“yes, it is true!”) and by responding to it you assent to it. For you hear the words, “the Body 
of Christ” and respond “Amen.” Be then a member of the Body of Christ that your Amen may 










be true.225 


1397 The Eucharist commits us to the poor. To receive in truth the Body and Blood of Christ given 
up for us, we must recognize Christ in the poorest, his brethren: (2449) 

You have tasted the Blood of the Lord, yet you do not recognize your brother,.... You dishonor 
this table when you do not judge worthy of sharing your food someone judged worthy to take 
part in this meal.... God freed you from all your sins and invited you here, but you have not 
become more merciful.228 

1398 The Eucharist and the unity of Christians. Before the greatness of this mystery St. Augustine 
exclaims, “O sacrament of devotion! O sign of unity! O bond of charity /”22Z The more painful the 
experience of the divisions in the Church which break the common participation in the table of the 
Lord, the more urgent are our prayers to the Lord that the time of complete unity among all who 
believe in him may return. ( 817 ) 

1399 The Eastern churches that are not in full communion with the Catholic Church celebrate the 
Eucharist with great love. “These Churches, although separated from us, yet possess true 
sacraments, above all—by apostolic succession—the priesthood and the Eucharist, whereby they 
are still joined to us in closest intimacy.” A certain communion in sacris, and so in the Eucharist, 
“given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely possible but is 

encouraged. ”228 (838) 

1400 Ecclesial communities derived from the Reformation and separated from the Catholic Church, 
“have not preserved the proper reality of the Eucharistic mystery in its fullness, especially because 
of the absence of the sacrament of Holy Orders. ”289 j t j s f or q-pg reason that, for the Catholic 
Church, Eucharistic intercommunion with these communities is not possible. However these 
ecclesial communities, “when they commemorate the Lord’s death and resurrection in the Holy 
Supper... profess that it signifies life in communion with Christ and await his coming in glory. ”218 
(1536) 

1401 When, in the Ordinary’s judgment, a grave necessity arises, Catholic ministers may give the 
sacraments of Eucharist, Penance, and Anointing of the Sick to other Christians not in full 
communion with the Catholic Church, who ask for them of their own will, provided they give 
evidence of holding the Catholic faith regarding these sacraments and possess the required 
dispositions. 211 ( 1483 . 1385 1 








VII. The Eucharist — “Pledge of the Glory to Come” 


1402 In an ancient prayer the Church acclaims the mystery of the Eucharist: “O sacred banquet in 
which Christ is received as food, the memory of his Passion is renewed, the soul is filled with grace 
and a pledge of the life to come is given to us.” If the Eucharist is the memorial of the Passover of 
the Lord Jesus, if by our communion at the altar we are filled “with every heavenly blessing and 
grace, ”242 then the Eucharist is also an anticipation of the heavenly glory. (1323, 1130 1 

1403 At the Last Supper the Lord himself directed his disciples’ attention toward the fulfillment of 
the Passover in the kingdom of God: “I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until 
that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”243 Whenever the Church 
celebrates the Eucharist she remembers this promise and turns her gaze “to him who is to come.” In 
her prayer she calls for his coming: “Marana tha!” “Come, Lord Jesus!”244 “May your grace come 
and this world pass away! ”245 ( 671 ) 

1404 The Church knows that the Lord comes even now in his Eucharist and that he is there in our 
midst. However, his presence is veiled. Therefore we celebrate the Eucharist “awaiting the blessed 
hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ, ”246 asking “to share in your glory when every tear 
will be wiped away. On that day we shall see you, our God, as you are. We shall become like you 
and praise you for ever through Christ our Lord.”24Z ( 1041 . 1028 1 

1405 There is no surer pledge or clearer sign of this great hope in the new heavens and new earth 
“in which righteousness dwells, ”246 than the Eucharist. Every time this mystery is celebrated, “the 
work of our redemption is carried on” and we “break the one bread that provides the medicine of 
immortality, the antidote for death, and the food that makes us live for ever in Jesus Christ.”249 
( 1042 . 1000 1 


IN BRIEF 

1406 Jesus said: “I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, 
he will live for ever;... he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and... abides in 
me, and I in him” (Jn 6:51, 54, 56). 

1407 The Eucharist is the heart and the summit of the Church’s life, for in it Christ associates his 
Church and all her members with his sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving offered once for all on the 











cross to his Father; by this sacrifice he pours out the graces of salvation on his Body which is the 
Church. 

1408 The Eucharistic celebration always includes: the proclamation of the Word of God; 
thanksgiving to God the Father for all his benefits, above all the gift of his Son; the consecration of 
bread and wine; and participation in the liturgical banquet by receiving the Lord’s body and blood. 
These elements constitute one single act of worship. 

1409 The Eucharist is the memorial of Christ’s Passover, that is, of the work of salvation 
accomplished by the life, death, and resurrection of Christ, a work made present by the liturgical 
action. 

1410 It is Christ himself, the eternal high priest of the New Covenant who, acting through the 
ministry of the priests, offers the Eucharistic sacrifice. And it is the same Christ, really present 
under the species of bread and wine, who is the offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice. 

1411 Only validly ordained priests can preside at the Eucharist and consecrate the bread and the 
wine so that they become the Body and Blood of the Lord. 

1412 The essential signs of the Eucharistic sacrament are wheat bread and grape wine, on which the 
blessing of the Holy Spirit is invoked and the priest pronounces the words of consecration spoken 
by Jesus during the Last Supper: “This is my body which will be given up for you.... This is the cup 
of my blood....” 

1413 By the consecration the transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of 
Christ is brought about. Under the consecrated species of bread and wine Christ himself, living and 
glorious, is present in a true, real, and substantial manner: his Body and his Blood, with his soul 
and his divinity (cf. Council of Trent: DS 1640; 1651). 

1414 As sacrifice, the Eucharist is also offered in reparation for the sins of the living and the dead 
and to obtain spiritual or temporal benefits from God. 

1415 Anyone who desires to receive Christ in Eucharistic communion must be in the state of grace. 
Anyone aware of having sinned mortally must not receive communion without having received 
absolution in the sacrament of penance. 


1416 Communion with the Body and Blood of Christ increases the communicant’s union with the 



Lord, forgives his venial sins, and preserves him from grave sins. Since receiving this sacrament 
strengthens the bonds of charity between the communicant and Christ, it also reinforces the unity of 
the Church as the Mystical Body of Christ. 

1417 The Church warmly recommends that the faithful receive Holy Communion when they 
participate in the celebration of the Eucharist; she obliges them to do so at least once a year. 

1418 Because Christ himself is present in the sacrament of the altar, he is to be honored with the 
worship of adoration. “To visit the Blessed Sacrament is... a proof of gratitude, an expression of 
love, and a duty of adoration toward Christ our Lord” (Paul VI, MF 66). 

1419 Having passed from this world to the Father, Christ gives us in the Eucharist the pledge of 
glory with him. Participation in the Holy Sacrifice identifies us with his Heart, sustains our strength 
along the pilgrimage of this life, makes us long for eternal life, and unites us even now to the 
Church in heaven, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and all the saints.

CHAPTER TWO 

THE SACRAMENTS OF HEALING 


1420 Through the sacraments of Christian initiation, man receives the new life of Christ. Now we 
carry this life “in earthen vessels,” and it remains “hidden with Christ in God.”i We are still in our 
“earthly tent,” subject to suffering, illness, and death .2 This new life as a child of God can be 
weakened and even lost by sin. 

1421 The Lord Jesus Christ, physician of our souls and bodies, who forgave the sins of the 
paralytic and restored him to bodily health, 2 has willed that his Church continue, in the power of 
the Holy Spirit, his work of healing and salvation, even among her own members. This is the 
purpose of the two sacraments of healing: the sacrament of Penance and the sacrament of Anointing 
of the Sick. 

ARTICLE 4 

THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE AND RECONCILIATION 


1422 “Those who approach the sacrament of Penance obtain pardon from God’s mercy for the 
offense committed against him, and are, at the same time, reconciled with the Church which they 
have wounded by their sins and which by charity, by example, and by prayer labors for their 
conversion.’’^ (980) 

I. What Is This Sacrament Called? 

1423 It is called the sacrament of conversion because it makes sacramentally present Jesus’ call to 
conversion, the first step in returning to the Father^ from whom one has strayed by sin. 1 1989 . 
1440) 

It is called the sacrament of Penance, since it consecrates the Christian sinner’s personal and 
ecclesial steps of conversion, penance, and satisfaction. 

1424 It is called the sacrament of confession, since the disclosure or confession of sins to a priest is 
an essential element of this sacrament. In a profound sense it is also a “confession” — 
acknowledgment and praise—of the holiness of God and of his mercy toward sinful man. 1 1456 . 
1449 . 1442) 

It is called the sacrament of forgiveness, since by the priest’s sacramental absolution God 











grants the penitent “pardon and peace.”? 

It is called the sacrament of Reconciliation, because it imparts to the sinner the love of God 
who reconciles: “Be reconciled to God.”? He who lives by God’s merciful love is ready to respond 
to the Lord’s call: “Go; first be reconciled to your brother.”? 

II. Why a Sacrament of Reconciliation after Baptism? 

1425 “You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ and in the Spirit of our God.”? One must appreciate the magnitude of the gift God has given 
us in the sacraments of Christian initiation in order to grasp the degree to which sin is excluded for 
him who has “put on Christ.”!? But the apostle John also says: “If we say we have no sin, we 
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”!i And the Lord himself taught us to pray: “Forgive us 
our trespasses,”!? linking our forgiveness of one another’s offenses to the forgiveness of our sins 
that God will grant us. ( 1263 . 2838 ) 

1426 Conversion to Christ, the new birth of Baptism, the gift of the Holy Spirit and the Body and 
Blood of Christ received as food have made us “holy and without blemish,” just as the Church 
herself, the Bride of Christ, is “holy and without blemish.”!? Nevertheless the new life received in 
Christian initiation has not abolished the frailty and weakness of human nature, nor the inclination 
to sin that tradition calls concupiscence, which remains in the baptized such that with the help of 
the grace of Christ they may prove themselves in the struggle of Christian life. 14 This is the 
struggle of conversion directed toward holiness and eternal life to which the Lord never ceases to 
call us.!? (405, 9Z8, 1264 1 

III. The Conversion of the Baptized 

1427 Jesus calls to conversion. This call is an essential part of the proclamation of the kingdom: 
“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel.”!? i n 
the Church’s preaching this call is addressed first to those who do not yet know Christ and his 
Gospel. Also, Baptism is the principal place for the first and fundamental conversion. It is by faith 
in the Gospel and by Baptism!? that one renounces evil and gains salvation, that is, the forgiveness 
of all sins and the gift of new life. (541, 1226 1 

1428 Christ’s call to conversion continues to resound in the lives of Christians. This second 
conversion is an uninterrupted task for the whole Church who, “clasping sinners to her bosom, [is] 
at once holy and always in need of purification, [and] follows constantly the path of penance and 









renewal.”^ This endeavor of conversion is not just a human work. It is the movement of a “contrite 
heart,” drawn and moved by grace to respond to the merciful love of God who loved us first.^ 
1 1036 . 853 . 1996 1 

1429 St. Peter’s conversion after he had denied his master three times bears witness to this. Jesus’ 
look of infinite mercy drew tears of repentance from Peter and, after the Lord’s resurrection, a 
threefold affirmation of love for him.20 The second conversion also has a communitarian 
dimension, as is clear in the Lord’s call to a whole Church: “Repent!”21 

St. Ambrose says of the two conversions that, in the Church, “there are water and tears: the 
water of Baptism and the tears of repentance.”^ - 

IV. Interior Penance 

1430 Jesus’ call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before him, does not aim first 
at outward works, “sackcloth and ashes,” fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the 
heart, interior conversion. Without this, such penances remain sterile and false; however, interior 
conversion urges expression in visible signs, gestures and works of penance. 23 (1098) 

1431 Interior repentance is a radical reorientation of our whole life, a return, a conversion to God 
with all our heart, an end of sin, a turning away from evil, with repugnance toward the evil actions 
we have committed. At the same time it entails the desire and resolution to change one’s life, with 
hope in God’s mercy and trust in the help of his grace. This conversion of heart is accompanied by 
a salutary pain and sadness which the Fathers called animi cruciatus (affliction of spirit) and 
compuncdo cordis (repentance of heart).2d ( 1451 . 368 1 

1432 The human heart is heavy and hardened. God must give man a new hearth Conversion is 
first of all a work of the grace of God who makes our hearts return to him: “Restore us to thyself, O 
LORD, that we may be restored !”2h God gives us the strength to begin anew. It is in discovering 
the greatness of God’s love that our heart is shaken by the horror and weight of sin and begins to 
fear offending God by sin and being separated from him. The human heart is converted by looking 
upon him whom our sins have pierced: 22 (1989) 

Let us fix our eyes on Christ’s blood and understand how precious it is to his Father, for, 
poured out for our salvation, it has brought to the whole world the grace of repentance.23 

1433 Since Easter, the Holy Spirit has proved “the world wrong about sin, ”29 i.e., proved that the 









world has not believed in him whom the Father has sent. But this same Spirit who brings sin to 
light is also the Consoler who gives the human heart grace for repentance and conversion.^ ( 729 . 
692 . 1848 1 

V. The Many Forms of Penance in Christian Life 

1434 The interior penance of the Christian can be expressed in many and various ways. Scripture 
and the Fathers insist above all on three forms, fasting, prayer, and almsgiving ,21 which express 
conversion in relation to oneself, to God, and to others. Alongside the radical purification brought 
about by Baptism or martyrdom they cite as means of obtaining forgiveness of sins: efforts at 
reconciliation with one’s neighbor, tears of repentance, concern for the salvation of one’s neighbor, 
the intercession of the saints, and the practice of charity “which covers a multitude of sins. ”22 
(1969) 

1435 Conversion is accomplished in daily life by gestures of reconciliation, concern for the poor, 
the exercise and defense of justice and right, 22 by the admission of faults to one’s brethren, 
fraternal correction, revision of life, examination of conscience, spiritual direction, acceptance of 
suffering, endurance of persecution for the sake of righteousness. Taking up one’s cross each day 
and following Jesus is the surest way of penance.21 

1436 Eucharist and Penance. Daily conversion and penance find their source and nourishment in 
the Eucharist, for in it is made present the sacrifice of Christ which has reconciled us with God. 
Through the Eucharist those who live from the life of Christ are fed and strengthened. “It is a 
remedy to free us from our daily faults and to preserve us from mortal sins. ”22 ( 1394 ) 

1437 Reading Sacred Scripture, praying the Liturgy of the Hours and the Our Father—every 
sincere act of worship or devotion revives the spirit of conversion and repentance within us and 
contributes to the forgiveness of our sins. 

1438 The seasons and days of penance in the course of the liturgical year (Lent, and each Friday in 
memory of the death of the Lord) are intense moments of the Church’s penitential practice. 22 These 
times are particularly appropriate for spiritual exercises, penitential liturgies, pilgrimages as signs 
of penance, voluntary self-denial such as fasting and almsgiving, and fraternal sharing (charitable 
and missionary works). (540, 2043 ) 

1439 The process of conversion and repentance was described by Jesus in the parable of the 
prodigal son, the center of which is the merciful father ;2Z the fascination of illusory freedom, the 










abandonment of the father’s house; the extreme misery in which the son finds himself after 
squandering his fortune; his deep humiliation at finding himself obliged to feed swine, and still 
worse, at wanting to feed on the husks the pigs ate; his reflection on all he has lost; his repentance 
and decision to declare himself guilty before his father; the journey back; the father’s generous 
welcome; the father’s joy—all these are characteristic of the process of conversion. The beautiful 
robe, the ring, and the festive banquet are symbols of that new life—pure, worthy, and joyful—of 
anyone who returns to God and to the bosom of his family, which is the Church. Only the heart of 
Christ who knows the depths of his Father’s love could reveal to us the abyss of his mercy in so 
simple and beautiful a way. ( 545 ) 

VI. The Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation 

1440 Sin is before all else an offense against God, a rupture of communion with him. At the same 
time it damages communion with the Church. For this reason conversion entails both God’s 
forgiveness and reconciliation with the Church, which are expressed and accomplished liturgically 
by the sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation.^ (1850) 

Only God forgives sin 

1441 Only God forgives sins.^ Since he is the Son of God, Jesus says of himself, “The Son of man 
has authority on earth to forgive sins” and exercises this divine power: “Your sins are forgiven.”^ 
Further, by virtue of his divine authority he gives this power to men to exercise in his name.^l ( 270 . 
431 . 589) 

1442 Christ has willed that in her prayer and life and action his whole Church should be the sign 
and instrument of the forgiveness and reconciliation that he acquired for us at the price of his blood. 
But he entrusted the exercise of the power of absolution to the apostolic ministry which he charged 
with the “ministry of reconciliation.”^ The apostle is sent out “on behalf of Christ” with “God 
making his appeal” through him and pleading: “Be reconciled to God.”^ ( 983 ) 

Reconciliation with the Church 

1443 During his public life Jesus not only forgave sins, but also made plain the effect of this 
forgiveness: he reintegrated forgiven sinners into the community of the People of God from which 
sin had alienated or even excluded them. A remarkable sign of this is the fact that Jesus receives 
sinners at his table, a gesture that expresses in an astonishing way both God’s forgiveness and the 
return to the bosom of the People of God.^4 (545) 










1444 In imparting to his apostles his own power to forgive sins the Lord also gives them the 
authority to reconcile sinners with the Church. This ecclesial dimension of their task is expressed 
most notably in Christ’s solemn words to Simon Peter: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of 
heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth 
shall be loosed in heaven.”45 “The office of binding and loosing which was given to Peter was also 
assigned to the college of the apostles united to its head.”^ (981) 

1445 The words bind and loose mean: whomever you exclude from your communion, will be 
excluded from communion with God; whomever you receive anew into your communion, God will 
welcome back into his. Reconciliation with the Church is inseparable from reconciliation with 
God. (553) 

The sacrament of forgiveness 

1446 Christ instituted the sacrament of Penance for all sinful members of his Church: above all for 
those who, since Baptism, have fallen into grave sin, and have thus lost their baptismal grace and 
wounded ecclesial communion. It is to them that the sacrament of Penance offers a new possibility 
to convert and to recover the grace of justification. The Fathers of the Church present this 
sacrament as “the second plank [of salvation] after the shipwreck which is the loss of grace. 
1 979 . 1856 . 1990 1 

1447 Over the centuries the concrete form in which the Church has exercised this power received 
from the Lord has varied considerably. During the first centuries the reconciliation of Christians 
who had committed particularly grave sins after their Baptism (for example, idolatry, murder, or 
adultery) was tied to a very rigorous discipline, according to which penitents had to do public 
penance for their sins, often for years, before receiving reconciliation. To this “order of penitents” 
(which concerned only certain grave sins), one was only rarely admitted and in certain regions only 
once in a lifetime. During the seventh century Irish missionaries, inspired by the Eastern monastic 
tradition, took to continental Europe the “private” practice of penance, which does not require 
public and prolonged completion of penitential works before reconciliation with the Church. From 
that time on, the sacrament has been performed in secret between penitent and priest. This new 
practice envisioned the possibility of repetition and so opened the way to a regular frequenting of 
this sacrament. It allowed the forgiveness of grave sins and venial sins to be integrated into one 
sacramental celebration. In its main lines this is the form of penance that the Church has practiced 
down to our day. 







1448 Beneath the changes in discipline and celebration that this sacrament has undergone over the 
centuries, the same fundamental structure is to be discerned. It comprises two equally essential 
elements: on the one hand, the acts of the man who undergoes conversion through the action of the 
Holy Spirit: namely, contrition, confession, and satisfaction; on the other, God’s action through the 
intervention of the Church. The Church, who through the bishop and his priests forgives sins in the 
name of Jesus Christ and determines the manner of satisfaction, also prays for the sinner and does 
penance with him. Thus the sinner is healed and re-established in ecclesial communion. 

1449 The formula of absolution used in the Latin Church expresses the essential elements of this 
sacrament: the Father of mercies is the source of all forgiveness. He effects the reconciliation of 
sinners through the Passover of his Son and the gift of his Spirit, through the prayer and ministry of 
the Church: ( 1481 . 234) 

God, the Father of mercies, 

through the death and the resurrection of his Son 

has reconciled the world to himself 

and sent the Holy Spirit among us 

for the forgiveness of sins; 

through the ministry of the Church 

may God give you pardon and peace, 

and I absolve you from your sins 

in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.^ 

VII. The Acts of the Penitent 

1450 “Penance requires... the sinner to endure all things willingly, be contrite of heart, confess with 
the lips, and practice complete humility and fruitful satisfaction.”^ 

Contrition 

1451 Among the penitent’s acts contrition occupies first place. Contrition is “sorrow of the soul and 
detestation for the sin committed, together with the resolution not to sin again.”^ (431) 

1452 When it arises from a love by which God is loved above all else, contrition is called “perfect” 
(contrition of charity). Such contrition remits venial sins; it also obtains forgiveness of mortal sins 
if it includes the firm resolution to have recourse to sacramental confession as soon as possible. 
(1822) 






1453 The contrition called “imperfect” (or “attrition”) is also a gift of God, a prompting of the Holy 
Spirit. It is born of the consideration of sin’s ugliness or the fear of eternal damnation and the other 
penalties threatening the sinner (contrition of fear). Such a stirring of conscience can initiate an 
interior process which, under the prompting of grace, will be brought to completion by sacramental 
absolution. By itself however, imperfect contrition cannot obtain the forgiveness of grave sins, but 
it disposes one to obtain forgiveness in the sacrament of Penance. ^ 

1454 The reception of this sacrament ought to be prepared for by an examination of conscience 
made in the light of the Word of God. The passages best suited to this can be found in the Ten 
Commandments, the moral catechesis of the Gospels and the apostolic Letters, such as the Sermon 
on the Mount and the apostolic teachings.^ 

The confession of sins 

1455 The confession (or disclosure) of sins, even from a simply human point of view, frees us and 
facilitates our reconciliation with others. Through such an admission man looks squarely at the sins 
he is guilty of, takes responsibility for them, and thereby opens himself again to God and to the 
communion of the Church in order to make a new future possible. ( 1424 . 1734 ) 

1456 Confession to a priest is an essential part of the sacrament of Penance: “All mortal sins of 
which penitents after a diligent self-examination are conscious must be recounted by them in 
confession, even if they are most secret and have been committed against the last two precepts of 
the Decalogue; for these sins sometimes wound the soul more grievously and are more dangerous 
than those which are committed openly.”^ (1855, 1505 1 

When Christ’s faithful strive to confess all the sins that they can remember, they undoubtedly 
place all of them before the divine mercy for pardon. But those who fail to do so and 
knowingly withhold some, place nothing before the divine goodness for remission through the 
mediation of the priest, “for if the sick person is too ashamed to show his wound to the doctor, 
the medicine cannot heal what it does not know.”^ 

1457 According to the Church’s command, “after having attained the age of discretion, each of the 
faithful is bound by an obligation faithfully to confess serious sins at least once a year.”^ Anyone 
who is aware of having committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy Communion, even if he 
experiences deep contrition, without having first received sacramental absolution, unless he has a 
grave reason for receiving Communion and there is no possibility of going to confession.^ 
Children must go to the sacrament of Penance before receiving Holy Communion for the first 






time.52 ( 2042 . 1385 ^ 


1458 Without being strictly necessary, confession of everyday faults (venial sins) is nevertheless 
strongly recommended by the Church.-^ Indeed the regular confession of our venial sins helps us 
form our conscience, fight against evil tendencies, let ourselves be healed by Christ and progress in 
the life of the Spirit. By receiving more frequently through this sacrament the gift of the Father’s 
mercy, we are spurred to be merciful as he is merciful:^ ( 1783 . 2468 1 

Whoever confesses his sins... is already working with God. God indicts your sins; if you also 
indict them, you are joined with God. Man and sinner are, so to speak, two realities: when you 
hear “man” — this is what God has made; when you hear “sinner” — this is what man himself 
has made. Destroy what you have made, so that God may save what he has made.... When you 
begin to abhor what you have made, it is then that your good works are beginning, since you 
are accusing yourself of your evil works. The beginning of good works is the confession of 
evil works. You do the truth and come to the light. hi 
Satisfaction 

1459 Many sins wrong our neighbor. One must do what is possible in order to repair the harm (e.g., 
return stolen goods, restore the reputation of someone slandered, pay compensation for injuries). 
Simple justice requires as much. But sin also injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his 
relationships with God and neighbor. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the 
disorders sin has caused.h2 Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health 
by doing something more to make amends for the sin: he must “make satisfaction for” or “expiate” 
his sins. This satisfaction is also called “penance.” ( 2412 . 2487 . 1473 1 

1460 The penance the confessor imposes must take into account the penitent’s personal situation 
and must seek his spiritual good. It must correspond as far as possible with the gravity and nature 
of the sins committed. It can consist of prayer, an offering, works of mercy, service of neighbor, 
voluntary self-denial, sacrifices, and above all the patient acceptance of the cross we must bear. 
Such penances help configure us to Christ, who alone expiated our sins once for all. They allow us 
to become co-heirs with the risen Christ, “provided we suffer with him.”h3 ( 2447 . 618 . 2011 ) 

The satisfaction that we make for our sins, however, is not so much ours as though it were not 
done through Jesus Christ. We who can do nothing ourselves, as if just by ourselves, can do all 
things with the cooperation of “him who strengthens” us. Thus man has nothing of which to 
boast, but all our boasting is in Christ... in whom we make satisfaction by bringing forth 












“fruits that befit repentance.” These fruits have their efficacy from him, by him they are 
offered to the Father, and through him they are accepted by the Father.^ 

VIII. The Minister of This Sacrament 

1461 Since Christ entrusted to his apostles the ministry of reconciliation,^ bishops who are their 
successors, and priests, the bishops’ collaborators, continue to exercise this ministry. Indeed 
bishops and priests, by virtue of the sacrament of Holy Orders, have the power to forgive all sins 
“in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” ( 981 ) 

1462 Forgiveness of sins brings reconciliation with God, but also with the Church. Since ancient 
times the bishop, visible head of a particular Church, has thus rightfully been considered to be the 
one who principally has the power and ministry of reconciliation: he is the moderator of the 
penitential discipline.^ Priests, his collaborators, exercise it to the extent that they have received 
the commission either from their bishop (or religious superior) or the Pope, according to the law of 
the Church.hZ (886, 1567 1 

1463 Certain particularly grave sins incur excommunication, the most severe ecclesiastical penalty, 
which impedes the reception of the sacraments and the exercise of certain ecclesiastical acts, and 
for which absolution consequently cannot be granted, according to canon law, except by the Pope, 
the bishop of the place or priests authorized by them.hH In danger of death any priest, even if 
deprived of faculties for hearing confessions, can absolve from every sin and excommunication.^ 
(982) 

1464 Priests must encourage the faithful to come to the sacrament of Penance and must make 
themselves available to celebrate this sacrament each time Christians reasonably ask for it.22 

1465 When he celebrates the sacrament of Penance, the priest is fulfilling the ministry of the Good 
Shepherd who seeks the lost sheep, of the Good Samaritan who binds up wounds, of the Father 
who awaits the prodigal son and welcomes him on his return, and of the just and impartial judge 
whose judgment is both just and merciful. The priest is the sign and the instrument of God’s 
merciful love for the sinner. (983) 

1466 The confessor is not the master of God’s forgiveness, but its servant. The minister of this 
sacrament should unite himself to the intention and charity of Christ.^1 He should have a proven 
knowledge of Christian behavior, experience of human affairs, respect and sensitivity toward the 
one who has fallen; he must love the truth, be faithful to the Magisterium of the Church, and lead 







the penitent with patience toward healing and full maturity. He must pray and do penance for his 
penitent, entrusting him to the Lord’s mercy. ( 1551 . 2690 1 

1467 Given the delicacy and greatness of this ministry and the respect due to persons, the Church 
declares that every priest who hears confessions is bound under very severe penalties to keep 
absolute secrecy regarding the sins that his penitents have confessed to him. He can make no use of 
knowledge that confession gives him about penitents’ lives.22 This secret, which admits of no 
exceptions, is called the “sacramental seal,” because what the penitent has made known to the priest 
remains “sealed” by the sacrament. (2490) 

IX. The Effects of This Sacrament 

1468 “The whole power of the sacrament of Penance consists in restoring us to God’s grace and 
joining us with him in an intimate friendship.”^ Reconciliation with God is thus the purpose and 
effect of this sacrament. For those who receive the sacrament of Penance with contrite heart and 
religious disposition, reconciliation “is usually followed by peace and serenity of conscience with 
strong spiritual consolation.”^ Indeed the sacrament of Reconciliation with God brings about a 
true “spiritual resurrection,” restoration of the dignity and blessings of the life of the children of 
God, of which the most precious is friendship with God.^ ( 2305 ) 

1469 This sacrament reconciles us with the Church. Sin damages or even breaks fraternal 
communion. The sacrament of Penance repairs or restores it. In this sense it does not simply heal 
the one restored to ecclesial communion, but has also a revitalizing effect on the life of the Church 
which suffered from the sin of one of her members. § Re-established or strengthened in the 
communion of saints, the sinner is made stronger by the exchange of spiritual goods among all the 
living members of the Body of Christ, whether still on pilgrimage or already in the heavenly 
homeland:^ (953, 949) 

It must be recalled that... this reconciliation with God leads, as it were, to other reconciliations, 
which repair the other breaches caused by sin. The forgiven penitent is reconciled with himself 
in his inmost being, where he regains his innermost truth. He is reconciled with his brethren 
whom he has in some way offended and wounded. He is reconciled with the Church. He is 
reconciled with all creation.^ 

1470 In this sacrament, the sinner, placing himself before the merciful judgment of God, 
anticipates in a certain way the judgment to which he will be subjected at the end of his earthly life. 








For it is now, in this life, that we are offered the choice between life and death, and it is only by the 
road of conversion that we can enter the Kingdom, from which one is excluded by grave sin. 1 In 
converting to Christ through penance and faith, the sinner passes from death to life and “does not 
come into judgment.”^ (678, 1039 1 

X. Indulgences 

1471 The doctrine and practice of indulgences in the Church are closely linked to the effects of the 
sacrament of Penance. 

What is an indulgence? 

“An indulgence is a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has 
already been forgiven, which the faithful Christian who is duly disposed gains under certain 
prescribed conditions through the action of the Church which, as the minister of redemption, 
dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the satisfactions of Christ and the saints. 

“An indulgence is partial or plenary according as it removes either part or all of the temporal 
punishment due to sin.”^ The faithful can gain indulgences for themselves or apply them to the 
dead.^3 


The punishments of sin 

1472 To understand this doctrine and practice of the Church, it is necessary to understand that sin 
has a double consequence. Grave sin deprives us of communion with God and therefore makes us 
incapable of eternal life, the privation of which is called the “eternal punishment” of sin. On the 
other hand every sin, even venial, entails an unhealthy attachment to creatures, which must be 
purified either here on earth, or after death in the state called Purgatory. This purification frees one 
from what is called the “temporal punishment” of sin. These two punishments must not be 
conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted by God from without, but as following from the very 
nature of sin. A conversion which proceeds from a fervent charity can attain the complete 
purification of the sinner in such a way that no punishment would remain.^ 1 1861 . 1031 1 

1473 The forgiveness of sin and restoration of communion with God entail the remission of the 
eternal punishment of sin, but temporal punishment of sin remains. While patiently bearing 
sufferings and trials of all kinds and, when the day comes, serenely facing death, the Christian must 
strive to accept this temporal punishment of sin as a grace. He should strive by works of mercy and 
charity, as well as by prayer and the various practices of penance, to put off completely the “old 






man” and to put on the “new man.”^ (2447) 

In the Communion of Saints 

1474 The Christian who seeks to purify himself of his sin and to become holy with the help of 
God’s grace is not alone. “The life of each of God’s children is joined in Christ and through Christ 
in a wonderful way to the life of all the other Christian brethren in the supernatural unity of the 
Mystical Body of Christ, as in a single mystical person.”Sh ( 946-959 . 795) 

1475 In the communion of saints, “a perennial link of charity exists between the faithful who have 
already reached their heavenly home, those who are expiating their sins in purgatory and those who 
are still pilgrims on earth. Between them there is, too, an abundant exchange of all good things.”^ 
In this wonderful exchange, the holiness of one profits others, well beyond the harm that the sin of 
one could cause others. Thus recourse to the communion of saints lets the contrite sinner be more 
promptly and efficaciously purified of the punishments for sin. 

1476 We also call these spiritual goods of the communion of saints the Church’s treasury, which is 
“not the sum total of the material goods which have accumulated during the course of the centuries. 
On the contrary the Treasury of the Church’ is the infinite value, which can never be exhausted, 
which Christ’s merits have before God. They were offered so that the whole of mankind could be 
set free from sin and attain communion with the Father. In Christ, the Redeemer himself, the 
satisfactions and merits of his Redemption exist and find their efficacy.”^ ( 617 1 

1477 “This treasury includes as well the prayers and good works of the Blessed Virgin Mary. They 
are truly immense, unfathomable, and even pristine in their value before God. In the treasury, too, 
are the prayers and good works of all the saints, all those who have followed in the footsteps of 
Christ the Lord and by his grace have made their lives holy and carried out the mission the Father 
entrusted to them. In this way they attained their own salvation and at the same time cooperated in 
saving their brothers in the unity of the Mystical Body.”^ ( 969 1 

Obtaining indulgence from God through the Church 

1478 An indulgence is obtained through the Church who, by virtue of the power of binding and 
loosing granted her by Christ Jesus, intervenes in favor of individual Christians and opens for them 
the treasury of the merits of Christ and the saints to obtain from the Father of mercies the remission 
of the temporal punishments due for their sins. Thus the Church does not want simply to come to 
the aid of these Christians, but also to spur them to works of devotion, penance, and charity.^ 
( 981 1 








1479 Since the faithful departed now being purified are also members of the same communion of 
saints, one way we can help them is to obtain indulgences for them, so that the temporal 
punishments due for their sins may be remitted. ( 1032 ) 

XI. The Celebration of the Sacrament of Penance 

1480 Like all the sacraments, Penance is a liturgical action. The elements of the celebration are 
ordinarily these: a greeting and blessing from the priest, reading the word of God to illuminate the 
conscience and elicit contrition, and an exhortation to repentance; the confession, which 
acknowledges sins and makes them known to the priest; the imposition and acceptance of a 
penance; the priest’s absolution; a prayer of thanksgiving and praise and dismissal with the blessing 
of the priest. 

1481 The Byzantine Liturgy recognizes several formulas of absolution, in the form of invocation, 
which admirably express the mystery of forgiveness: “May the same God, who through the Prophet 
Nathan forgave David when he confessed his sins, who forgave Peter when he wept bitterly, the 
prostitute when she washed his feet with her tears, the publican, and the prodigal son, through me, a 
sinner, forgive you both in this life and in the next and enable you to appear before his awe¬ 
inspiring tribunal without condemnation, he who is blessed for ever and ever. Amen.” ( 1449 ) 

1482 The sacrament of Penance can also take place in the framework of a communal celebration in 
which we prepare ourselves together for confession and give thanks together for the forgiveness 
received. Here, the personal confession of sins and individual absolution are inserted into a liturgy 
of the word of God with readings and a homily, an examination of conscience conducted in 
common, a communal request for forgiveness, the Our Father and a thanksgiving in common. This 
communal celebration expresses more clearly the ecclesial character of penance. However, 
regardless of its manner of celebration the sacrament of Penance is always, by its very nature, a 
liturgical action, and therefore an ecclesial and public action.^ (1140) 

1483 In case of grave necessity recourse may be had to a communal celebration of reconciliation 
with general confession and general absolution. Grave necessity of this sort can arise when there is 
imminent danger of death without sufficient time for the priest or priests to hear each penitent’s 
confession. Grave necessity can also exist when, given the number of penitents, there are not 
enough confessors to hear individual confessions properly in a reasonable time, so that the 
penitents through no fault of their own would be deprived of sacramental grace or Holy 
Communion for a long time. In this case, for the absolution to be valid the faithful must have the 





intention of individually confessing their grave sins in the time required.^ The diocesan bishop is 
the judge of whether or not the conditions required for general absolution exist.23 A large gathering 
of the faithful on the occasion of major feasts or pilgrimages does not constitute a case of grave 
necessity .24 (1401) 

1484 “Individual, integral confession and absolution remain the only ordinary way for the faithful 
to reconcile themselves with God and the Church, unless physical or moral impossibility excuses 
from this kind of confession. ”22 There are profound reasons for this. Christ is at work in each of the 
sacraments. He personally addresses every sinner: “My son, your sins are forgiven.”22 He is the 
physician tending each one of the sick who need him to cure them.22 He raises them up and 
reintegrates them into fraternal communion. Personal confession is thus the form most expressive 
of reconciliation with God and with the Church. (878) 


IN BRIEF 

1485 “On the evening of that day, the first day of the week,” Jesus showed himself to his apostles. 
“He breathed on them, and said to them: 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, 
they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained’” (Jn 20:19, 22-23). 

1486 The forgiveness of sins committed after Baptism is conferred by a particular sacrament called 
the sacrament of conversion, confession, penance, or reconciliation. 

1487 The sinner wounds God’s honor and love, his own human dignity as a man called to be a son 
of God, and the spiritual well-being of the Church, of which each Christian ought to be a living 
stone. 

1488 To the eyes of faith no evil is graver than sin and nothing has worse consequences for sinners 
themselves, for the Church, and for the whole world. 

1489 To return to communion with God after having lost it through sin is a process born of the 
grace of God who is rich in mercy and solicitous for the salvation of men. One must ask for this 
precious gift for oneself and for others. 

1490 The movement of return to God, called conversion and repentance, entails sorrow for and 
abhorrence of sins committed, and the firm purpose of sinning no more in the future. Conversion 
touches the past and the future and is nourished by hope in God’s mercy. 






1491 The sacrament of Penance is a whole consisting in three actions of the penitent and the 
priest’s absolution. The penitent’s acts are repentance, confession or disclosure of sins to the priest, 
and the intention to make reparation and do works of reparation. 

1492 Repentance (also called contrition) must be inspired by motives that arise from faith. If 
repentance arises from love of charity for God, it is called “perfect” contrition; if it is founded on 
other motives, it is called “imperfect.” 

1493 One who desires to obtain reconciliation with God and with the Church, must confess to a 
priest all the unconfessed grave sins he remembers after having carefully examined his conscience. 
The confession of venial faults, without being necessary in itself, is nevertheless strongly 
recommended by the Church. 

1494 The confessor proposes the performance of certain acts of “satisfaction” or “penance” to be 
performed by the penitent in order to repair the harm caused by sin and to re-establish habits 
befitting a disciple of Christ. 

1495 Only priests who have received the faculty of absolving from the authority of the Church can 
forgive sins in the name of Christ. 

1496 The spiritual effects of the sacrament of Penance are: 

—reconciliation with God by which the penitent recovers grace; 

—reconciliation with the Church; 

—remission of the eternal punishment incurred by mortal sins; 

—remission, at least in part, of temporal punishments resulting from sin; 

—peace and serenity of conscience, and spiritual consolation; 

—an increase of spiritual strength for the Christian battle. 

1497 Individual and integral confession of grave sins followed by absolution remains the only 
ordinary means of reconciliation with God and with the Church. 

1498 Through indulgences the faithful can obtain the remission of temporal punishment resulting 
from sin for themselves and also for the souls in Purgatory. 


ARTICLE 5 

THE ANOINTING OF THE SICK 




1499 “By the sacred anointing of the sick and the prayer of the priests the whole Church commends 
those who are ill to the suffering and glorified Lord, that he may raise them up and save them. And 
indeed she exhorts them to contribute to the good of the People of God by freely uniting themselves 
to the Passion and death of Christ.”^ 

I. Its Foundations in the Economy of Salvation 

Illness in human life 

1500 Illness and suffering have always been among the gravest problems confronted in human life. 
In illness, man experiences his powerlessness, his limitations, and his finitude. Every illness can 
make us glimpse death. (1006) 

1501 Illness can lead to anguish, self-absorption, sometimes even despair and revolt against God. It 
can also make a person more mature, helping him discern in his life what is not essential so that he 
can turn toward that which is. Very often illness provokes a search for God and a return to him. 

The sick person before God 

1502 The man of the Old Testament lives his sickness in the presence of God. It is before God that 
he laments his illness, and it is of God, Master of life and death, that he implores healing.^ Illness 
becomes a way to conversion; God’s forgiveness initiates the healing.lQO It is the experience of 
Israel that illness is mysteriously linked to sin and evil, and that faithfulness to God according to his 
law restores life: “For I am the Lord, your healer.”Hll The prophet intuits that suffering can also 
have a redemptive meaning for the sins of others.lQ= Finally Isaiah announces that God will usher 
in a time for Zion when he will pardon every offense and heal every illness.!^ ( 164 . 376 1 

Christ the physician 

1503 Christ’s compassion toward the sick and his many healings of every kind of infirmity are a 
resplendent sign that “God has visited his people”i24 and that the Kingdom of God is close at hand. 
Jesus has the power not only to heal, but also to forgive sins;l£5 he has come to heal the whole 
man, soul and body; he is the physician the sick have need of.l^ His compassion toward all who 
suffer goes so far that he identifies himself with them: “I was sick and you visited me.’TJV His 
preferential love for the sick has not ceased through the centuries to draw the very special attention 
of Christians toward all those who suffer in body and soul. It is the source of tireless efforts to 
comfort them. 1 549 . 1421 . 2288 1 









1504 Often Jesus asks the sick to believe. 122 He makes use of signs to heal: spittle and the laying 
on of hands, mud and washing.H2 The sick try to touch him, “for power came forth from him 
and healed them all.”— And so in the sacraments Christ continues to “touch” us in order to heal 
us. (695, 1116 1 

1505 Moved by so much suffering Christ not only allows himself to be touched by the sick, but he 
makes their miseries his own: “He took our infirmities and bore our diseases. ”H2 But he did not 
heal all the sick. His healings were signs of the coming of the Kingdom of God. They announced a 
more radical healing: the victory over sin and death through his Passover. On the cross Christ took 
upon himself the whole weight of evil and took away the “sin of the world, ”H3 0 f which illness is 
only a consequence. By his passion and death on the cross Christ has given a new meaning to 
suffering: it can henceforth configure us to him and unite us with his redemptive Passion. (440, 
307 1 

“Heal the sick...” 

1506 Christ invites his disciples to follow him by taking up their cross in their turn.Hl By 
following him they acquire a new outlook on illness and the sick. Jesus associates them with his 
own life of poverty and service. He makes them share in his ministry of compassion and healing: 
“So they went out and preached that men should repent. And they cast out many demons, and 
anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them. ”115 (859) 

1507 The risen Lord renews this mission (“In my name... they will lay their hands on the sick, and 
they will recover.”H2) and confirms it through the signs that the Church performs by invoking his 
name.TLZ These signs demonstrate in a special way that Jesus is truly “God who saves. ”H2 ( 430 1 

1508 The Holy Spirit gives to some a special charism of healingHS so as to make manifest the 
power of the grace of the risen Lord. But even the most intense prayers do not always obtain the 
healing of all illnesses. Thus St. Paul must learn from the Lord that “my grace is sufficient for you, 
for my power is made perfect in weakness,” and that the sufferings to be endured can mean that “in 
my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his Body, that is, the 
Church. ”120 (798 s 618 ) 

1509 “Heal the sick!”121 The Church has received this charge from the Lord and strives to carry it 
out by taking care of the sick as well as by accompanying them with her prayer of intercession. She 
believes in the life-giving presence of Christ, the physician of souls and bodies. This presence is 
particularly active through the sacraments, and in an altogether special way through the Eucharist, 










the bread that gives eternal life and that St. Paul suggests is connected with bodily health.122 (1405) 


1510 However, the apostolic Church has its own rite for the sick, attested to by St. James: “Is any 
among you sick? Let him call for the elders [ presbyters ] of the Church and let them pray over him, 
anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and 
the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.”423 Tradition has 
recognized in this rite one of the seven sacraments. 124 (1117) 

A sacrament of the sick 

1511 The Church believes and confesses that among the seven sacraments there is one especially 
intended to strengthen those who are being tried by illness, the Anointing of the Sick: 

This sacred anointing of the sick was instituted by Christ our Lord as a true and proper 
sacrament of the New Testament. It is alluded to indeed by Mark, but is recommended to the 
faithful and promulgated by James the apostle and brother of the Lord.422 

1512 From ancient times in the liturgical traditions of both East and West, we have testimonies to 
the practice of anointings of the sick with blessed oil. Over the centuries the Anointing of the Sick 
was conferred more and more exclusively on those at the point of death. Because of this it received 
the name “Extreme Unction.” Notwithstanding this evolution the liturgy has never failed to beg the 
Lord that the sick person may recover his health if it would be conducive to his salvation. 42b 

1513 The Apostolic Constitution Sacram unctionem infirmorum ,12 following upon the Second 
Vatican Council, 422 established that henceforth, in the Roman Rite, the following be observed: 

The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is given to those who are seriously ill by anointing 
them on the forehead and hands with duly blessed oil—pressed from olives or from other 
plants—saying, only once: “Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy 
help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit. May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and 
raise you up. ”429 

II. Who Receives and Who Administers This Sacrament? 

In case of grave illness... 

1514 The Anointing of the Sick “is not a sacrament for those only who are at the point of death. 




Hence, as soon as anyone of the faithful begins to be in danger of death from sickness or old age, 
the fitting time for him to receive this sacrament has certainly already arrived.”!^ 

1515 If a sick person who received this anointing recovers his health, he can in the case of another 
grave illness receive this sacrament again. If during the same illness the person’s condition 
becomes more serious, the sacrament may be repeated. It is fitting to receive the Anointing of the 
Sick just prior to a serious operation. The same holds for the elderly whose frailty becomes more 
pronounced. 

“...let him call for the presbyters of the Church” 

1516 Only priests (bishops and presbyters) are ministers of the Anointing of the Sick.12! It is the 
duty of pastors to instruct the faithful on the benefits of this sacrament. The faithful should 
encourage the sick to call for a priest to receive this sacrament. The sick should prepare themselves 
to receive it with good dispositions, assisted by their pastor and the whole ecclesial community, 
which is invited to surround the sick in a special way through their prayers and fraternal attention. 

III. How Is This Sacrament Celebrated? 

1517 Like all the sacraments the Anointing of the Sick is a liturgical and communal celebration,!^ 
whether it takes place in the family home, a hospital or church, for a single sick person or a whole 
group of sick persons. It is very fitting to celebrate it within the Eucharist, the memorial of the 
Lord’s Passover. If circumstances suggest it, the celebration of the sacrament can be preceded by 
the sacrament of Penance and followed by the sacrament of the Eucharist. As the sacrament of 
Christ’s Passover the Eucharist should always be the last sacrament of the earthly journey, the 
“viaticum” for “passing over” to eternal life. ( 1140 . 1524 1 

1518 Word and sacrament form an indivisible whole. The Liturgy of the Word, preceded by an act 
of repentance, opens the celebration. The words of Christ, the witness of the apostles, awaken the 
faith of the sick person and of the community to ask the Lord for the strength of his Spirit. 

1519 The celebration of the sacrament includes the following principal elements: the “priests of the 
Church”!^ —in silence—lay hands on the sick; they pray over them in the faith of the Church!^ — 
this is the epiclesis proper to this sacrament; they then anoint them with oil blessed, if possible, by 
the bishop. 

These liturgical actions indicate what grace this sacrament confers upon the sick. 





IV. The Effects of the Celebration of This Sacrament 


1520 A particular gift of the Holy Spirit. The first grace of this sacrament is one of strengthening, 
peace and courage to overcome the difficulties that go with the condition of serious illness or the 
frailty of old age. This grace is a gift of the Holy Spirit, who renews trust and faith in God and 
strengthens against the temptations of the evil one, the temptation to discouragement and anguish in 
the face of death.l^ This assistance from the Lord by the power of his Spirit is meant to lead the 
sick person to healing of the soul, but also of the body if such is God’s will.l^f? Furthermore, “if he 
has committed sins, he will be forgiven.”^ ( 733 ) 

1521 Union with the passion of Christ. By the grace of this sacrament the sick person receives the 
strength and the gift of uniting himself more closely to Christ’s Passion: in a certain way he is 
consecrated to bear fruit by configuration to the Savior’s redemptive Passion. Suffering, a 
consequence of original sin, acquires a new meaning; it becomes a participation in the saving work 
of Jesus. ( 1535 . 1499 1 

1522 An ecclesial grace. The sick who receive this sacrament, “by freely uniting themselves to the 
passion and death of Christ,” “contribute to the good of the People of God.”l^ By celebrating this 
sacrament the Church, in the communion of saints, intercedes for the benefit of the sick person, and 
he, for his part, though the grace of this sacrament, contributes to the sanctification of the Church 
and to the good of all men for whom the Church suffers and offers herself through Christ to God 
the Father. ( 953 1 

1523 A preparation for the final journey. If the sacrament of anointing of the sick is given to all 
who suffer from serious illness and infirmity, even more rightly is it given to those at the point of 
departing this life; so it is also called sacramentum exeuntium (the sacrament of those 
departing).^ The Anointing of the Sick completes our conformity to the death and Resurrection of 
Christ, just as Baptism began it. It completes the holy anointings that mark the whole Christian life: 
that of Baptism which sealed the new life in us, and that of Confirmation which strengthened us for 
the combat of this life. This last anointing fortifies the end of our earthly life like a solid rampart for 
the final struggles before entering the Father’s house.l^Q (1020, 1294 . 1020 1 

V. Viaticum, the Last Sacrament of the Christian 

1524 In addition to the Anointing of the Sick, the Church offers those who are about to leave this 
life the Eucharist as viaticum. Communion in the body and blood of Christ, received at this moment 









of “passing over” to the Father, has a particular significance and importance. It is the seed of eternal 
life and the power of resurrection, according to the words of the Lord: “He who eats my flesh and 
drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”i4i The sacrament of Christ 
once dead and now risen, the Eucharist is here the sacrament of passing over from death to life, 
from this world to the Father.^ (1392) 

1525 Thus, just as the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and the Eucharist form a unity called 
“the sacraments of Christian initiation,” so too it can be said that Penance, the Anointing of the 
Sick and the Eucharist as viaticum constitute at the end of Christian life “the sacraments that 
prepare for our heavenly homeland” or the sacraments that complete the earthly pilgrimage. 1 1680 .

IN BRIEF 

1526 “Is any among you sick? Let him call for the presbyters of the Church, and let them pray over 
him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, 
and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven” (Jas 5:14-15). 

1527 The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick has as its purpose the conferral of a special grace on 
the Christian experiencing the difficulties inherent in the condition of grave illness or old age. 

1528 The proper time for receiving this holy anointing has certainly arrived when the believer 
begins to be in danger of death because of illness or old age. 

1529 Each time a Christian falls seriously ill, he may receive the Anointing of the Sick, and also 
when, after he has received it, the illness worsens. 

1530 Only priests (presbyters and bishops) can give the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, 
using oil blessed by the bishop, or if necessary by the celebrating presbyter himself. 

1531 The celebration of the Anointing of the Sick consists essentially in the anointing of the 
forehead and hands of the sick person (in the Roman Rite) or of other parts of the body (in the 
Eastern rite), the anointing being accompanied by the liturgical prayer of the celebrant asking for 
the special grace of this sacrament. 

1532 The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects: 







—the uniting of the sick person to the passion of Christ, for his own good and that of the whole 
Church; 

—the strengthening, peace, and courage to endure in a Christian manner the sufferings of 
illness or old age; 

—the forgiveness of sins, if the sick person was not able to obtain it through the sacrament of 
Penance; 

—the restoration of health, if it is conducive to the salvation of his soul; 

—the preparation for passing over to eternal life.

CHAPTER THREE 

THE SACRAMENTS AT THE SERVICE OF COMMUNION 


1533 Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist are sacraments of Christian initiation. They ground the 
common vocation of all Christ’s disciples, a vocation to holiness and to the mission of evangelizing 
the world. They confer the graces needed for the life according to the Spirit during this life as 
pilgrims on the march towards the homeland. 1 1212 1 

1534 Two other sacraments, Holy Orders and Matrimony, are directed towards the salvation of 
others; if they contribute as well to personal salvation, it is through service to others that they do so. 
They confer a particular mission in the Church and serve to build up the People of God. 

1535 Through these sacraments those already consecrated by Baptism and Confirmation! for the 
common priesthood of all the faithful can receive particular consecrations. Those who receive the 
sacrament of Holy Orders are consecrated in Christ’s name “to feed the Church by the word and 
grace of God.”^ On their part, “Christian spouses are fortified and, as it were, consecrated for the 
duties and dignity of their state by a special sacrament.”^ (784) 

ARTICLE 6 

THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS 


1536 Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles 
continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time: thus it is the sacrament of apostolic 
ministry. It includes three degrees: episcopate, presbyterate, and diaconate. ( 860 1 

(On the institution and mission of the apostolic ministry by Christ, see above, no. 874 ff. Here 
only the sacramental means by which this ministry is handed on will be treated.) 

I. Why Is This Sacrament Called “Orders”? 

1537 The word order in Roman antiquity designated an established civil body, especially a 
governing body. Ordinatio means incorporation into an ordo. In the Church there are established 
bodies which Tradition, not without a basis in Sacred Scripture, 4 has since ancient times called 
taxeis (Greek) or ordines. And so the liturgy speaks of the ordo episcoporum, the ordo 
presbyterorum, the ordo diaconorum. Other groups also receive this name of ordo: catechumens, 







virgins, spouses, widows,.... ( 922 . 923 . 1631) 


1538 Integration into one of these bodies in the Church was accomplished by a rite called 
ordinatio, a religious and liturgical act which was a consecration, a blessing or a sacrament. Today 
the word “ ordination ” is reserved for the sacramental act which integrates a man into the order of 
bishops, presbyters, or deacons, and goes beyond a simple election, designation, delegation, or 
institution by the community, for it confers a gift of the Holy Spirit that permits the exercise of a 
“sacred power” ( sacra potestas which can come only from Christ himself through his Church. 
Ordination is also called consecratio, for it is a setting apart and an investiture by Christ himself for 
his Church. The laying on of hands by the bishop, with the consecratory prayer, constitutes the 
visible sign of this ordination. (875, 699) 

II. The Sacrament of Holy Orders in the Economy of Salvation 

The priesthood of the Old Covenant 

1539 The chosen people was constituted by God as “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.”^ But 
within the people of Israel, God chose one of the twelve tribes, that of Levi, and set it apart for 
liturgical service; God himself is its inheritance.^ A special rite consecrated the beginnings of the 
priesthood of the Old Covenant. The priests are “appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to 
God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.”£ 

1540 Instituted to proclaim the Word of God and to restore communion with God by sacrifices and 
prayer,S this priesthood nevertheless remains powerless to bring about salvation, needing to repeat 
its sacrifices ceaselessly and being unable to achieve a definitive sanctification, which only the 
sacrifice of Christ would accomplish.^ ( 2099 1 

1541 The liturgy of the Church, however, sees in the priesthood of Aaron and the service of the 
Levites, as in the institution of the seventy elders, Id a prefiguring of the ordained ministry of the 
New Covenant. Thus in the Latin Rite the Church prays in the consecratory preface of the 
ordination of bishops: 

God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,... 
by your gracious word 

you have established the plan of your Church. 

From the beginning, 

you chose the descendants of Abraham to be your holy nation. 








You established rulers and priests, 

and did not leave your sanctuary without ministers to serve you.... 12 

1542 At the ordination of priests, the Church prays: 

Lord, holy Father,... 

when you had appointed high priests to rule your people, 
you chose other men next to them in rank and dignity 
to be with them and to help them in their task.... 
you extended the spirit of Moses to seventy wise men.... 

You shared among the sons of Aaron 
the fullness of their father’s power. 12 

1543 In the consecratory prayer for ordination of deacons, the Church confesses: 

Almighty God..., 

You make the Church, Christ’s body, 

grow to its full stature as a new and greater temple. 

You enrich it with every kind of grace 

and perfect it with a diversity of members 

to serve the whole body in a wonderful pattern of unity. 

You established a threefold ministry of worship and service, 
for the glory of your name. 

As ministers of your tabernacle you chose the sons of Levi 
and gave them your blessing as their everlasting inheritance. 14 

The one priesthood of Christ 

1544 Everything that the priesthood of the Old Covenant prefigured finds its fulfillment in Christ 
Jesus, the “one mediator between God and men.”12 The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, 
“priest of God Most High,” as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique “high priest 
after the order of Melchizedek”; 12 “holy, blameless, unstained, ”H “by a single offering he has 
perfected for all time those who are sanctified, ”12 that is, by the unique sacrifice of the cross. ( 874 ) 

1545 The redemptive sacrifice of Christ is unique, accomplished once for all; yet it is made present 
in the Eucharistic sacrifice of the Church. The same is true of the one priesthood of Christ; it is 
made present through the ministerial priesthood without diminishing the uniqueness of Christ’s 



priesthood: “Only Christ is the true priest, the others being only his ministers.”!! (1367, 662) 


Two participations in the one priesthood of Christ 

1546 Christ, high priest and unique mediator, has made of the Church “a kingdom, priests for his 
God and Father.”!! The whole community of believers is, as such, priestly. The faithful exercise 
their baptismal priesthood through their participation, each according to his own vocation, in 
Christ’s mission as priest, prophet, and king. Through the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation 
the faithful are “consecrated to be... a holy priesthood.”!! (1268) 

1547 The ministerial or hierarchical priesthood of bishops and priests, and the common priesthood 
of all the faithful participate, “each in its own proper way, in the one priesthood of Christ.” While 
being “ordered one to another,” they differ essentially.!! In what sense? While the common 

priesthood of the faithful is exercised by the unfolding of baptismal grace-a life of faith, hope, 

and charity, a life according to the Spirit—, the ministerial priesthood is at the service of the 
common priesthood. It is directed at the unfolding of the baptismal grace of all Christians. The 
ministerial priesthood is a means by which Christ unceasingly builds up and leads his Church. For 
this reason it is transmitted by its own sacrament, the sacrament of Holy Orders. ( 1142 . 1120 1 

In the person of Christ the Head... 

1548 In the ecclesial service of the ordained minister, it is Christ himself who is present to his 
Church as Head of his Body, Shepherd of his flock, high priest of the redemptive sacrifice, Teacher 
of Truth. This is what the Church means by saying that the priest, by virtue of the sacrament of 
Holy Orders, acts in persona Christi Capitis ;!! ( 875 . 792 ) 

It is the same priest, Christ Jesus, whose sacred person his minister truly represents. Now the 
minister, by reason of the sacerdotal consecration which he has received, is truly made like to 
the high priest and possesses the authority to act in the power and place of the person of Christ 
himself ( virtute ac persona ipsius Christi ).!4 

Christ is the source of all priesthood: the priest of the old law was a figure of Christ, and the 
priest of the new law acts in the person of Christ.!! 

1549 Through the ordained ministry, especially that of bishops and priests, the presence of Christ 
as head of the Church is made visible in the midst of the community of believers.!! In the beautiful 
expression of St. Ignatius of Antioch, the bishop is typos tou Patros: he is like the living image of 










God the Father. 2 ( 1142 ) 


1550 This presence of Christ in the minister is not to be understood as if the latter were preserved 
from all human weaknesses, the spirit of domination, error, even sin. The power of the Holy Spirit 
does not guarantee all acts of ministers in the same way. While this guarantee extends to the 
sacraments, so that even the minister’s sin cannot impede the fruit of grace, in many other acts the 
minister leaves human traces that are not always signs of fidelity to the Gospel and consequently 
can harm the apostolic fruitfulness of the Church. ( 896 . 1128 . 1584) 

1551 This priesthood is ministerial. “That office... which the Lord committed to the pastors of his 
people, is in the strict sense of the term a service It is entirely related to Christ and to men. It 
depends entirely on Christ and on his unique priesthood; it has been instituted for the good of men 
and the communion of the Church. The sacrament of Holy Orders communicates a “sacred power” 
which is none other than that of Christ. The exercise of this authority must therefore be measured 
against the model of Christ, who by love made himself the least and the servant of all.22 “The Lord 
said clearly that concern for his flock was proof of love for him.”^0 (876, 1538 . 608 1 

...“in the name of the whole Church” 

1552 The ministerial priesthood has the task not only of representing Christ—Head of the Church 
—before the assembly of the faithful, but also of acting in the name of the whole Church when 
presenting to God the prayer of the Church, and above all when offering the Eucharistic sacrifice.^ 

1553 “In the name of the whole Church” does not mean that priests are the delegates of the 
community. The prayer and offering of the Church are inseparable from the prayer and offering of 
Christ, her head; it is always the case that Christ worships in and through his Church. The whole 
Church, the Body of Christ, prays and offers herself “through him, with him, in him,” in the unity 
of the Holy Spirit, to God the Father. The whole Body, caput et membra, prays and offers itself, 
and therefore those who in the Body are especially his ministers are called ministers not only of 
Christ, but also of the Church. It is because the ministerial priesthood represents Christ that it can 
represent the Church. 1 795 1 

III. The Three Degrees of the Sacrament of Holy Orders 

1554 “The divinely instituted ecclesiastical ministry is exercised in different degrees by those who 
even from ancient times have been called bishops, priests, and deacons. ”22 Catholic doctrine, 
expressed in the liturgy, the Magisterium, and the constant practice of the Church, recognizes that 










there are two degrees of ministerial participation in the priesthood of Christ: the episcopacy and the 
presbyterate. The diaconate is intended to help and serve them. For this reason the term sacerdos in 
current usage denotes bishops and priests but not deacons. Yet Catholic doctrine teaches that the 
degrees of priestly participation (episcopate and presbyterate) and the degree of service (diaconate) 
are all three conferred by a sacramental act called “ordination,” that is, by the sacrament of Holy 
Orders: &lt; 1536 . 1538 1 

Let everyone revere the deacons as Jesus Christ, the bishop as the image of the Father, and the 
presbyters as the senate of God and the assembly of the apostles. For without them one cannot 
speak of the Church.23 

Episcopal ordination—fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders 

1555 “Amongst those various offices which have been exercised in the Church from the earliest 
times the chief place, according to the witness of tradition, is held by the function of those who, 
through their appointment to the dignity and responsibility of bishop, and in virtue consequently of 
the unbroken succession going back to the beginning, are regarded as transmitters of the apostolic 
line ”34 (861) 

1556 To fulfil their exalted mission, “the apostles were endowed by Christ with a special 
outpouring of the Holy Spirit coming upon them, and by the imposition of hands they passed on to 
their auxiliaries the gift of the Spirit, which is transmitted down to our day through episcopal 
consecration.”^ ( 862 1 

1557 The Second Vatican Council “teaches... that the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders is 
conferred by episcopal consecration, that fullness namely which, both in the liturgical tradition of 
the Church and the language of the Fathers of the Church, is called the high priesthood, the acme 
(summa ) of the sacred ministry.”^ 

1558 “Episcopal consecration confers, together with the office of sanctifying, also the offices of 
teaching and ruling.... In fact... by the imposition of hands and through the words of the 
consecration, the grace of the Holy Spirit is given, and a sacred character is impressed in such wise 
that bishops, in an eminent and visible manner, take the place of Christ himself, teacher, shepherd, 
and priest, and act as his representative (in Eius persona agant ).”3Z “By virtue, therefore, of the 
Holy Spirit who has been given to them, bishops have been constituted true and authentic teachers 
of the faith and have been made pontiffs and pastors. ”32 (895, 1121 1 








1559 “One is constituted a member of the episcopal body in virtue of the sacramental consecration 
and by the hierarchical communion with the head and members of the college. ”22 The character 
and collegial nature of the episcopal order are evidenced among other ways by the Church’s 
ancient practice which calls for several bishops to participate in the consecration of a new bishop.4Q 
In our day, the lawful ordination of a bishop requires a special intervention of the Bishop of Rome, 
because he is the supreme visible bond of the communion of the particular Churches in the one 
Church and the guarantor of their freedom. (8 77, 882) 

1560 As Christ’s vicar, each bishop has the pastoral care of the particular Church entrusted to him, 
but at the same time he bears collegially with all his brothers in the episcopacy the solicitude for all 
the Churches: “Though each bishop is the lawful pastor only of the portion of the flock entrusted to 
his care, as a legitimate successor of the apostles he is, by divine institution and precept, 
responsible with the other bishops for the apostolic mission of the Church.”41 ( 833 . 886 1 

1561 The above considerations explain why the Eucharist celebrated by the bishop has a quite 
special significance as an expression of the Church gathered around the altar, with the one who 
represents Christ, the Good Shepherd and Head of his Church, presiding.42 ( 1369 ) 

The ordination of priests — co-workers of the bishops 

1562 “Christ, whom the Father hallowed and sent into the world, has, through his apostles, made 
their successors, the bishops namely, sharers in his consecration and mission; and these, in their 
turn, duly entrusted in varying degrees various members of the Church with the office of their 
ministry.”^ “The function of the bishops’ ministry was handed over in a subordinate degree to 
priests so that they might be appointed in the order of the priesthood and be co-workers of the 
episcopal order for the proper fulfillment of the apostolic mission that had been entrusted to it by 
Christ.”44 


1563 “Because it is joined with the episcopal order the office of priests shares in the authority by 
which Christ himself builds up and sanctifies and rules his Body. Hence the priesthood of priests, 
while presupposing the sacraments of initiation, is nevertheless conferred by its own particular 
sacrament. Through that sacrament priests by the anointing of the Holy Spirit are signed with a 
special character and so are configured to Christ the priest in such a way that they are able to act in 
the person of Christ the head. ”42 ( 1121 ) 


1564 “Whilst not having the supreme degree of the pontifical office, and notwithstanding the fact 
that they depend on the bishops in the exercise of their own proper power, the priests are for all that 








associated with them by reason of their sacerdotal dignity; and in virtue of the sacrament of Holy 
Orders, after the image of Christ, the supreme and eternal priest, they are consecrated in order to 
preach the Gospel and shepherd the faithful as well as to celebrate divine worship as true priests of 
the New Testament (611) 

1565 Through the sacrament of Holy Orders priests share in the universal dimensions of the 
mission that Christ entrusted to the apostles. The spiritual gift they have received in ordination 
prepares them, not for a limited and restricted mission, “but for the fullest, in fact the universal 
mission of salvation To the end of the earth , ’”41 “prepared in spirit to preach the Gospel 
everywhere.”^ (849) 

1566 “It is in the Eucharistic cult or in the Eucharistic assembly of the faithful ( synaxis ) that they 
exercise in a supreme degree their sacred office; there, acting in the person of Christ and 
proclaiming his mystery, they unite the votive offerings of the faithful to the sacrifice of Christ 
their head, and in the sacrifice of the Mass they make present again and apply, until the coming of 
the Lord, the unique sacrifice of the New Testament, that namely of Christ offering himself once 
for all a spotless victim to the Father.”^ From this unique sacrifice their whole priestly ministry 
draws its strength.^ ( 1369 . 611 1 

1567 “The priests, prudent cooperators of the episcopal college and its support and instrument, 
called to the service of the People of God, constitute, together with their bishop, a unique sacerdotal 
college (presbyterium ) dedicated, it is true, to a variety of distinct duties. In each local assembly of 
the faithful they represent, in a certain sense, the bishop, with whom they are associated in all trust 
and generosity; in part they take upon themselves his duties and solicitude and in their daily toils 
discharge them.”^l Priests can exercise their ministry only in dependence on the bishop and in 
communion with him. The promise of obedience they make to the bishop at the moment of 
ordination and the kiss of peace from him at the end of the ordination liturgy mean that the bishop 
considers them his co-workers, his sons, his brothers and his friends, and that they in return owe 
him love and obedience. ( 1462 . 2179 1 

1568 “All priests, who are constituted in the order of priesthood by the sacrament of Order, are 
bound together by an intimate sacramental brotherhood, but in a special way they form one priestly 
body in the diocese to which they are attached under their own bishop....The unity of the 
presbyterium finds liturgical expression in the custom of the presbyters’ imposing hands, after the 
bishop, during the rite of ordination. ( 1537 1 









The ordination of deacons — “in order to serve” 


1569 “At a lower level of the hierarchy are to be found deacons, who receive the imposition of 
hands ‘not unto the priesthood, but unto the ministry.’”^ At an ordination to the diaconate only the 
bishop lays hands on the candidate, thus signifying the deacon’s special attachment to the bishop in 
the tasks of his “diakonia.”^ 

1570 Deacons share in Christ’s mission and grace in a special way.^ The sacrament of Holy 
Orders marks them with an imprint (“character”) which cannot be removed and which configures 
them to Christ, who made himself the “deacon” or servant of all.^ Among other tasks, it is the task 
of deacons to assist the bishop and priests in the celebration of the divine mysteries, above all the 
Eucharist, in the distribution of Holy Communion, in assisting at and blessing marriages, in the 
proclamation of the Gospel and preaching, in presiding over funerals, and in dedicating themselves 
to the various ministries of charity. ^7 (H21) 

1571 Since the Second Vatican Council the Latin Church has restored the diaconate “as a proper 
and permanent rank of the hierarchy,”^ while the Churches of the East had always maintained it. 
This permanent diaconate, which can be conferred on married men, constitutes an important 
enrichment for the Church’s mission. Indeed it is appropriate and useful that men who carry out a 
truly diaconal ministry in the Church, whether in its liturgical and pastoral life or whether in its 
social and charitable works, should “be strengthened by the imposition of hands which has come 
down from the apostles. They would be more closely bound to the altar and their ministry would be 
made more fruitful through the sacramental grace of the diaconate.”^ ( 1579 1 

IV. The Celebration of This Sacrament 

1572 Given the importance that the ordination of a bishop, a priest, or a deacon has for the life of 
the particular Church, its celebration calls for as many of the faithful as possible to take part. It 
should take place preferably on Sunday, in the cathedral, with solemnity appropriate to the 
occasion. All three ordinations, of the bishop, of the priest, and of the deacon, follow the same 
movement. Their proper place is within the Eucharistic liturgy. 

1573 The essential rite of the sacrament of Holy Orders for all three degrees consists in the 
bishop’s imposition of hands on the head of the ordinand and in the bishop’s specific consecratory 
prayer asking God for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and his gifts proper to the ministry to which 
the candidate is being ordained.^ (699, 1585 1 






1574 As in all the sacraments additional rites surround the celebration. Varying greatly among the 
different liturgical traditions, these rites have in common the expression of the multiple aspects of 
sacramental grace. Thus in the Latin Church, the initial rites—presentation and election of the 
ordinand, instruction by the bishop, examination of the candidate, litany of the saints—attest that 
the choice of the candidate is made in keeping with the practice of the Church and prepare for the 
solemn act of consecration, after which several rites symbolically express and complete the mystery 
accomplished: for bishop and priest, an anointing with holy chrism, a sign of the special anointing 
of the Holy Spirit who makes their ministry fruitful; giving the book of the Gospels, the ring, the 
miter, and the crosier to the bishop as the sign of his apostolic mission to proclaim the Word of 
God, of his fidelity to the Church, the bride of Christ, and his office as shepherd of the Lord’s 
flock; presentation to the priest of the paten and chalice, “the offering of the holy people” which he 
is called to present to God; giving the book of the Gospels to the deacon who has just received the 
mission to proclaim the Gospel of Christ. ( 1294 . 796) 

V. Who Can Confer This Sacrament? 

1575 Christ himself chose the apostles and gave them a share in his mission and authority. Raised 
to the Father’s right hand, he has not forsaken his flock but he keeps it under his constant protection 
through the apostles, and guides it still through these same pastors who continue his work today.bl 
Thus, it is Christ whose gift it is that some be apostles, others pastors. He continues to act through 
the bishops.h2 (857) 

1576 Since the sacrament of Holy Orders is the sacrament of the apostolic ministry, it is for the 
bishops as the successors of the apostles to hand on the “gift of the Spirit,the “apostolic line. ”§4 
Validly ordained bishops, i.e., those who are in the line of apostolic succession, validly confer the 
three degrees of the sacrament of Holy Orders.hS (1536) 

VI. Who Can Receive This Sacrament? 

1577 “Only a baptized man (vzr) validly receives sacred ordination.”hh The Lord Jesus chose men 
(ver) to form the college of the twelve apostles, and the apostles did the same when they chose 
collaborators to succeed them in their ministry.hZ The college of bishops, with whom the priests are 
united in the priesthood, makes the college of the twelve an ever-present and ever-active reality 
until Christ’s return. The Church recognizes herself to be bound by this choice made by the Lord 
himself. For this reason the ordination of women is not possible.^ (551 . 861 . 862) 









1578 No one has a right to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders. Indeed no one claims this office 
for himself; he is called to it by God.^2 Anyone who thinks he recognizes the signs of God’s call to 
the ordained ministry must humbly submit his desire to the authority of the Church, who has the 
responsibility and right to call someone to receive orders. Like every grace this sacrament can be 
received only as an unmerited gift. (2121) 

1579 All the ordained ministers of the Latin Church, with the exception of permanent deacons, are 
normally chosen from among men of faith who live a celibate life and who intend to remain 
celibate “for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.”2Q Called to consecrate themselves with undivided 
heart to the Lord and to “the affairs of the Lord, ”21 they give themselves entirely to God and to 
men. Celibacy is a sign of this new life to the service of which the Church’s minister is 
consecrated; accepted with a joyous heart celibacy radiantly proclaims the Reign of God.22 ( 1618 . 
2233 1 

1580 In the Eastern Churches a different discipline has been in force for many centuries: while 
bishops are chosen solely from among celibates, married men can be ordained as deacons and 
priests. This practice has long been considered legitimate; these priests exercise a fruitful ministry 
within their communities. 23 Moreover, priestly celibacy is held in great honor in the Eastern 
Churches and many priests have freely chosen it for the sake of the Kingdom of God. In the East as 
in the West a man who has already received the sacrament of Holy Orders can no longer marry. 

VII. The Effects of the Sacrament of Holy Orders 

The indelible character 

1581 This sacrament configures the recipient to Christ by a special grace of the Holy Spirit, so that 
he may serve as Christ’s instrument for his Church. By ordination one is enabled to act as a 
representative of Christ, Head of the Church, in his triple office of priest, prophet, and king. 1 1548 1 

1582 As in the case of Baptism and Confirmation this share in Christ’s office is granted once for 
all. The sacrament of Holy Orders, like the other two, confers an indelible spiritual character and 
cannot be repeated or conferred temporarily. -4 1 1121 1 

1583 It is true that someone validly ordained can, for grave reasons, be discharged from the 
obligations and functions linked to ordination, or can be forbidden to exercise them; but he cannot 
become a layman again in the strict sense, 22 because the character imprinted by ordination is for 


ever. 







The vocation and mission received on the day of his ordination mark him permanently. 


1584 Since it is ultimately Christ who acts and effects salvation through the ordained minister, the 
unworthiness of the latter does not prevent Christ from acting.Zh St. Augustine states this 
forcefully: ( 1128 . 1550 ) 

As for the proud minister, he is to be ranked with the devil. Christ’s gift is not thereby 
profaned: what flows through him keeps its purity, and what passes through him remains clear 
and reaches the fertile earth.... The spiritual power of the sacrament is indeed comparable to 
light: those to be enlightened receive it in its purity, and if it should pass through defiled 
beings, it is not itself defiled. 

The grace of the Holy Spirit 

1585 The grace of the Holy Spirit proper to this sacrament is configuration to Christ as Priest, 
Teacher, and Pastor, of whom the ordained is made a minister. 

1586 For the bishop, this is first of all a grace of strength (“the governing spirit”: Prayer of 
Episcopal Consecration in the Latin rite):^S the grace to guide and defend his Church with strength 
and prudence as a father and pastor, with gratuitous love for all and a preferential love for the poor, 
the sick, and the needy. This grace impels him to proclaim the Gospel to all, to be the model for his 
flock, to go before it on the way of sanctification by identifying himself in the Eucharist with Christ 
the priest and victim, not fearing to give his life for his sheep: (2448, 1558 1 

Father, you know all hearts. 

You have chosen your servant for the office of bishop. 

May he be a shepherd to your holy flock, 
and a high priest blameless in your sight, 
ministering to you night and day; 
may he always gain the blessing of your favor 
and offer the gifts of your holy Church. 

Through the Spirit who gives the grace of high priesthood 
grant him the power 
to forgive sins as you have commanded, 
to assign ministries as you have decreed, 

and to loose from every bond by the authority which you gave to your apostles. 

May he be pleasing to you by his gentleness and purity of heart, 






presenting a fragrant offering to you, 
through Jesus Christ, your Son.... ^2 

1587 The spiritual gift conferred by presbyteral ordination is expressed by this prayer of the 
Byzantine Rite. The bishop, while laying on his hand, says among other things: ( 1564 ) 

Lord, fill with the gift of the Holy Spirit 

him whom you have deigned to raise to the rank of the priesthood, 

that he may be worthy to stand without reproach before your altar, 

to proclaim the Gospel of your kingdom, 

to fulfill the ministry of your word of truth, 

to offer you spiritual gifts and sacrifices, 

to renew your people by the bath of rebirth; 

so that he may go out to meet 

our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, your only Son, 

on the day of his second coming, 

and may receive from your vast goodness 

the recompense for a faithful administration of his order.^ 

1588 With regard to deacons, “strengthened by sacramental grace they are dedicated to the People 
of God, in conjunction with the bishop and his body of priests, in the service ( diakonia ) of the 
liturgy, of the Gospel, and of works of charity. ”S1 ( 1569 1 

1589 Before the grandeur of the priestly grace and office, the holy doctors felt an urgent call to 
conversion in order to conform their whole lives to him whose sacrament had made them ministers. 
Thus St. Gregory of Nazianzus, as a very young priest, exclaimed: (460, 1551 1 

We must begin by purifying ourselves before purifying others; we must be instructed to be 
able to instruct, become light to illuminate, draw close to God to bring him close to others, be 
sanctified to sanctify, lead by the hand and counsel prudently. I know whose ministers we are, 
where we find ourselves and to where we strive. I know God’s greatness and man’s weakness, 
but also his potential. [Who then is the priest? He is] the defender of truth, who stands with 
angels, gives glory with archangels, causes sacrifices to rise to the altar on high, shares 
Christ’s priesthood, refashions creation, restores it in God’s image, recreates it for the world 
on high and, even greater, is divinized and divinizes.^ 


And the holy Cure of Ars: “The priest continues the work of redemption on earth.... If we 






really understood the priest on earth, we would die not of fright but of love.... The Priesthood 
is the love of the heart of Jesus. ”23 


IN BRIEF 

1590 St. Paul said to his disciple Timothy: “I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within 
you through the laying on of my hands” (2 Tim 1:6), and “If any one aspires to the office of bishop, 
he desires a noble task.” (1 Tim 3:1) To Titus he said: “This is why I left you in Crete, that you 
amend what was defective, and appoint presbyters in every town, as I directed you” (Titus 1:5). 

1591 The whole Church is a priestly people. Through Baptism all the faithful share in the 
priesthood of Christ. This participation is called the “common priesthood of the faithful.” Based on 
this common priesthood and ordered to its service, there exists another participation in the mission 
of Christ: the ministry conferred by the sacrament of Holy Orders, where the task is to serve in the 
name and in the person of Christ the Head in the midst of the community. 

1592 The ministerial priesthood differs in essence from the common priesthood of the faithful 
because it confers a sacred power for the service of the faithful. The ordained ministers exercise 
their service for the People of God by teaching (munus docendi ), divine worship (munus 
liturgicum ) and pastoral governance (munus regendi). 

1593 Since the beginning, the ordained ministry has been conferred and exercised in three degrees: 
that of bishops, that of presbyters, and that of deacons. The ministries conferred by ordination are 
irreplaceable for the organic structure of the Church: without the bishop, presbyters, and deacons, 
one cannot speak of the Church (cf. St. Ignatius of Antioch, Ad Trail. 3,1). 

1594 The bishop receives the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders, which integrates him into 
the episcopal college and makes him the visible head of the particular Church entrusted to him. As 
successors of the apostles and members of the college, the bishops share in the apostolic 
responsibility and mission of the whole Church under the authority of the Pope, successor of St. 
Peter. 

1595 Priests are united with the bishops in sacerdotal dignity and at the same time depend on them 
in the exercise of their pastoral functions; they are called to be the bishops’ prudent co-workers. 
They form around their bishop the presbyterium which bears responsibility with him for the 




particular Church. They receive from the bishop the charge of a parish community or a determinate 
ecclesial office. 

1596 Deacons are ministers ordained for tasks of service of the Church; they do not receive the 
ministerial priesthood, but ordination confers on them important functions in the ministry of the 
word, divine worship, pastoral governance, and the service of charity, tasks which they must carry 
out under the pastoral authority of their bishop. 

1597 The sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred by the laying on of hands followed by a solemn 
prayer of consecration asking God to grant the ordinand the graces of the Holy Spirit required for 
his ministry. Ordination imprints an indelible sacramental character. 

1598 The Church confers the sacrament of Holy Orders only on baptized men (vzrz), whose 
suitability for the exercise of the ministry has been duly recognized. Church authority alone has the 
responsibility and right to call someone to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders. 

1599 In the Latin Church the sacrament of Holy Orders for the presbyterate is normally conferred 
only on candidates who are ready to embrace celibacy freely and who publicly manifest their 
intention of staying celibate for the love of God’s kingdom and the service of men. 

1600 It is bishops who confer the sacrament of Holy Orders in the three degrees.

ARTICLE 7 

THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY 


1601 “The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a 
partnership of the whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the 
procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between baptized persons has been raised by 




Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament.”^ 


I. Marriage in God’s Plan 

1602 Sacred Scripture begins with the creation of man and woman in the image and likeness of 
God and concludes with a vision of “the wedding-feast of the Lamb. ”22 Scripture speaks 
throughout of marriage and its “mystery,” its institution and the meaning God has given it, its 
origin and its end, its various realizations throughout the history of salvation, the difficulties arising 
from sin and its renewal “in the Lord” in the New Covenant of Christ and the Church.22 (369, 796 ) 

Marriage in the order of creation 

1603 “The intimate community of life and love which constitutes the married state has been 
established by the Creator and endowed by him with its own proper laws.... God himself is the 
author of marriage.”27 The vocation to marriage is written in the very nature of man and woman as 
they came from the hand of the Creator. Marriage is not a purely human institution despite the 
many variations it may have undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures, 
and spiritual attitudes. These differences should not cause us to forget its common and permanent 
characteristics. Although the dignity of this institution is not transparent everywhere with the same 
clarity, 22 some sense of the greatness of the matrimonial union exists in all cultures. “The well¬ 
being of the individual person and of both human and Christian society is closely bound up with the 
healthy state of conjugal and family life. ”22 ( 371 . 2331 . 2210) 

1604 God who created man out of love also calls him to love—the fundamental and innate vocation 
of every human being. For man is created in the image and likeness of God who is himself love. 22 
Since God created him man and woman, their mutual love becomes an image of the absolute and 
unfailing love with which God loves man. It is good, very good, in the Creator’s eyes. And this 
love which God blesses is intended to be fruitful and to be realized in the common work of 
watching over creation: “And God blessed them, and God said to them: ‘Be fruitful and multiply, 
and fill the earth and subdue it. ’”21 ( 355 ) 

1605 Holy Scripture affirms that man and woman were created for one another: “It is not good that 
the man should be alone. ”22 The woman, “flesh of his flesh,” his equal, his nearest in all things, is 
given to him by God as a “helpmate”; she thus represents God from whom comes our help. 22 
“Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one 
flesh.”2d The Lord himself shows that this signifies an unbreakable union of their two lives by 









recalling what the plan of the Creator had been “in the beginning”: “So they are no longer two, but 
one flesh ”95 (372, 1614 1 


Marriage under the regime of sin 

1606 Every man experiences evil around him and within himself. This experience makes itself felt 
in the relationships between man and woman. Their union has always been threatened by discord, a 
spirit of domination, infidelity, jealousy, and conflicts that can escalate into hatred and separation. 
This disorder can manifest itself more or less acutely, and can be more or less overcome according 
to the circumstances of cultures, eras, and individuals, but it does seem to have a universal 
character. 

1607 According to faith the disorder we notice so painfully does not stem from the nature of man 
and woman, nor from the nature of their relations, but from sin. As a break with God, the first sin 
had for its first consequence the rupture of the original communion between man and woman. Their 
relations were distorted by mutual recriminations;^ their mutual attraction, the Creator’s own gift, 
changed into a relationship of domination and lust;97 and the beautiful vocation of man and woman 
to be fruitful, multiply, and subdue the earth was burdened by the pain of childbirth and the toil of 
work.98 (1849, 400) 

1608 Nevertheless, the order of creation persists, though seriously disturbed. To heal the wounds of 
sin, man and woman need the help of the grace that God in his infinite mercy never refuses them.^H 
Without his help man and woman cannot achieve the union of their lives for which God created 
them “in the beginning.” (55) 

Marriage under the pedagogy of the law 

1609 In his mercy God has not forsaken sinful man. The punishments consequent upon sin, “pain in 
childbearing” and toil “in the sweat of your brow, ”1^2 also embody remedies that limit the 
damaging effects of sin. After the fall, marriage helps to overcome self-absorption, egoism, pursuit 
of one’s own pleasure, and to open oneself to the other, to mutual aid and to self-giving. 1 410 1 

1610 Moral conscience concerning the unity and indissolubility of marriage developed under the 
pedagogy of the old law. In the Old Testament the polygamy of patriarchs and kings is not yet 
explicitly rejected. Nevertheless, the law given to Moses aims at protecting the wife from arbitrary 
domination by the husband, even though according to the Lord’s words it still carries traces of 
man’s “hardness of heart” which was the reason Moses permitted men to divorce their wives.HU 







( 1963 . 2387) 


1611 Seeing God’s covenant with Israel in the image of exclusive and faithful married love, the 
prophets prepared the Chosen People’s conscience for a deepened understanding of the unity and 
indissolubility of marriage.^ The books of Ruth and Tobit bear moving witness to an elevated 
sense of marriage and to the fidelity and tenderness of spouses. Tradition has always seen in the 
Song of Solomon a unique expression of human love, insofar as it is a reflection of God’s love—a 
love “strong as death” that “many waters cannot quench.”i22 ( 219 . 2380 . 2361 1 

Marriage in the Lord 

1612 The nuptial covenant between God and his people Israel had prepared the way for the new 
and everlasting covenant in which the Son of God, by becoming incarnate and giving his life, has 
united to himself in a certain way all mankind saved by him, thus preparing for “the wedding-feast 
of the Lamb. ”1^4 ( 521 ) 

1613 On the threshold of his public life Jesus performs his first sign—at his mother’s request— 
during a wedding feast.12^ The Church attaches great importance to Jesus’ presence at the wedding 
at Cana. She sees in it the confirmation of the goodness of marriage and the proclamation that 
thenceforth marriage will be an efficacious sign of Christ’s presence. 

1614 In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning of the union of man and 
woman as the Creator willed it from the beginning: permission given by Moses to divorce one’s 
wife was a concession to the hardness of hearts.^ The matrimonial union of man and woman is 
indissoluble: God himself has determined it: “what therefore God has joined together, let no man 
put asunder.”!^ 1 2336 . 2382 1 

1615 This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may have left some 
perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on 
spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy—heavier than the Law of Moses.l^ By coming 
to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to 
live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by following Christ, renouncing 
themselves, and taking up their crosses that spouses will be able to “receive” the original meaning 
of marriage and live it with the help of Christ.l^ This grace of Christian marriage is a fruit of 
Christ’s cross, the source of all Christian life. (2364, 1642) 


1616 This is what the Apostle Paul makes clear when he says: “Husbands, love your wives, as 













Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her,” adding at once: 
“For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall 
become one. This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the Church.”ilQ 

1617 The entire Christian life bears the mark of the spousal love of Christ and the Church. Already 
Baptism, the entry into the People of God, is a nuptial mystery; it is so to speak the nuptial bathd-LL 
which precedes the wedding feast, the Eucharist. Christian marriage in its turn becomes an 
efficacious sign, the sacrament of the covenant of Christ and the Church. Since it signifies and 
communicates grace, marriage between baptized persons is a true sacrament of the New 
Covenant.H2 (796) 

Virginity for the sake of the Kingdom 

1618 Christ is the center of all Christian life. The bond with him takes precedence over all other 
bonds, familial or social.!^ From the very beginning of the Church there have been men and 
women who have renounced the great good of marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he goes, to be 
intent on the things of the Lord, to seek to please him, and to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is 
coming.±i4 Christ himself has invited certain persons to follow him in this way of life, of which he 
remains the model: (2232, 1579 1 

“Lor there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been 
made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake 
of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.”iiS 

1619 Virginity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven is an unfolding of baptismal grace, a 
powerful sign of the supremacy of the bond with Christ and of the ardent expectation of his return, 
a sign which also recalls that marriage is a reality of this present age which is passing away.Uh 
1 922-924 1 

1620 Both the sacrament of Matrimony and virginity for the Kingdom of God come from the Lord 
himself. It is he who gives them meaning and grants them the grace which is indispensable for 
living them out in conformity with his will. HZ Esteem of virginity for the sake of the kingdom!!!! 
and the Christian understanding of marriage are inseparable, and they reinforce each other: 1 2349 1 

Whoever denigrates marriage also diminishes the glory of virginity. Whoever praises it makes 
virginity more admirable and resplendent. What appears good only in comparison with evil 
would not be truly good. The most excellent good is something even better than what is 







admitted to be good.H2 

II. The Celebration of Marriage 

1621 In the Latin Rite the celebration of marriage between two Catholic faithful normally takes 
place during Holy Mass, because of the connection of ah the sacraments with the Paschal mystery 
of Christ.!^ In the Eucharist the memorial of the New Covenant is realized, the New Covenant in 
which Christ has united himself for ever to the Church, his beloved bride for whom he gave himself 
up.121 It is therefore fitting that the spouses should seal their consent to give themselves to each 
other through the offering of their own lives by uniting it to the offering of Christ for his Church 
made present in the Eucharistic sacrifice, and by receiving the Eucharist so that, communicating in 
the same Body and the same Blood of Christ, they may form but “one body” in Christ.122 ( 1323 , 
1368 1 

1622 “Inasmuch as it is a sacramental action of sanctification, the liturgical celebration of 
marriage... must be, per se, valid, worthy, and fruitful. ”122 it is therefore appropriate for the bride 
and groom to prepare themselves for the celebration of their marriage by receiving the sacrament of 
penance. 1 1422 1 

1623 According to the Latin tradition, the spouses as ministers of Christ’s grace mutually confer 
upon each other the sacrament of Matrimony by expressing their consent before the Church. In the 
traditions of the Eastern Churches, the priests (bishops or presbyters) are witnesses to the mutual 
consent given by the spouses, 124 but for the validity of the sacrament their blessing is also 
necessary .122 

1624 The various liturgies abound in prayers of blessing and epiclesis asking God’s grace and 
blessing on the new couple, especially the bride. In the epiclesis of this sacrament the spouses 
receive the Holy Spirit as the communion of love of Christ and the Church.122 The Holy Spirit is 
the seal of their covenant, the ever-available source of their love and the strength to renew their 
fidelity. 1 736 1 

III. Matrimonial Consent 

1625 The parties to a marriage covenant are a baptized man and woman, free to contract marriage, 
who freely express their consent; “to be free” means: 1 1734 1 


not being under constraint; 







not impeded by any natural or ecclesiastical law. 


1626 The Church holds the exchange of consent between the spouses to be the indispensable 
element that “makes the marriage. ”!2Z if consent is lacking there is no marriage. (2201) 

1627 The consent consists in a “human act by which the partners mutually give themselves to each 
other”: “I take you to be my wife” — “I take you to be my husband.”!^ This consent that binds the 
spouses to each other finds its fulfillment in the two “becoming one flesh. ”222 

1628 The consent must be an act of the will of each of the contracting parties, free of coercion or 
grave external fear.-LTi N 0 human power can substitute for this consent.!^! If this freedom is 
lacking the marriage is invalid. ( 1735 ) 

1629 For this reason (or for other reasons that render the marriage null and void) the Church, after 
an examination of the situation by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal, can declare the nullity of a 
marriage, i.e., that the marriage never existed.!^ i n this case the contracting parties are free to 
marry, provided the natural obligations of a previous union are discharged.!^ 

1630 The priest (or deacon) who assists at the celebration of a marriage receives the consent of the 
spouses in the name of the Church and gives the blessing of the Church. The presence of the 
Church’s minister (and also of the witnesses) visibly expresses the fact that marriage is an ecclesial 
reality. 

1631 This is the reason why the Church normally requires that the faithful contract marriage 
according to the ecclesiastical form. Several reasons converge to explain this requirement;!^ 
1 1069 . 1537 . 2365 1 

—Sacramental marriage is a liturgical act. It is therefore appropriate that it should be celebrated 
in the public liturgy of the Church; 

—Marriage introduces one into an ecclesial order, and creates rights and duties in the Church 
between the spouses and towards their children; 

—Since marriage is a state of life in the Church, certainty about it is necessary (hence the 
obligation to have witnesses); 

—The public character of the consent protects the “I do” once given and helps the spouses 
remain faithful to it. 


1632 So that the “I do” of the spouses may be a free and responsible act and so that the marriage 







covenant may have solid and lasting human and Christian foundations, preparation for marriage is 
of prime importance. 1 2206 . 2350) 

The example and teaching given by parents and families remain the special form of this 
preparation. 

The role of pastors and of the Christian community as the “family of God” is indispensable for 
the transmission of the human and Christian values of marriage and family,^ and much more so 
in our era when many young people experience broken homes which no longer sufficiently assure 
this initiation: 

It is imperative to give suitable and timely instruction to young people, above all in the heart 
of their own families, about the dignity of married love, its role and its exercise, so that, 
having learned the value of chastity, they will be able at a suitable age to engage in honorable 
courtship and enter upon a marriage of their own.l^ 

Mixed marriages and disparity of cult 

1633 In many countries the situation of a mixed marriage (marriage between a Catholic and a 
baptized non-Catholic) often arises. It requires particular attention on the part of couples and their 
pastors. A case of marriage with disparity of cult (between a Catholic and a non-baptized person) 
requires even greater circumspection. 

1634 Difference of confession between the spouses does not constitute an insurmountable obstacle 
for marriage, when they succeed in placing in common what they have received from their 
respective communities, and learn from each other the way in which each lives in fidelity to Christ. 
But the difficulties of mixed marriages must not be underestimated. They arise from the fact that 
the separation of Christians has not yet been overcome. The spouses risk experiencing the tragedy 
of Christian disunity even in the heart of their own home. Disparity of cult can further aggravate 
these difficulties. Differences about faith and the very notion of marriage, but also different 
religious mentalities, can become sources of tension in marriage, especially as regards the 
education of children. The temptation to religious indifference can then arise. 1 817 1 

1635 According to the law in force in the Latin Church, a mixed marriage needs for liceity the 
express permission of ecclesiastical authority.!^ i n case of disparity of cult an express 
dispensation from this impediment is required for the validity of the marriage.^ This permission 
or dispensation presupposes that both parties know and do not exclude the essential ends and 
properties of marriage; and furthermore that the Catholic party confirms the obligations, which 





have been made known to the non-Catholic party, of preserving his or her own faith and ensuring 
the baptism and education of the children in the Catholic Church.129 

1636 Through ecumenical dialogue Christian communities in many regions have been able to put 
into effect a common pastoral practice for mixed marriages. Its task is to help such couples live out 
their particular situation in the light of faith, overcome the tensions between the couple’s 
obligations to each other and towards their ecclesial communities, and encourage the flowering of 
what is common to them in faith and respect for what separates them. ( 821 ) 

1637 In marriages with disparity of cult the Catholic spouse has a particular task: “For the 
unbelieving husband is consecrated through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated 
through her husband.’d^Q it is a great joy for the Christian spouse and for the Church if this 
“consecration” should lead to the free conversion of the other spouse to the Christian faith.i^l 
Sincere married love, the humble and patient practice of the family virtues, and perseverance in 
prayer can prepare the non-believing spouse to accept the grace of conversion.

IV. The Effects of the Sacrament of Matrimony 

1638 “From a valid marriage arises a bond between the spouses which by its very nature is 
perpetual and exclusive; furthermore, in a Christian marriage the spouses are strengthened and, as it 
were, consecrated for the duties and the dignity of their state by a special sacrament .”H 2 

The marriage bond 

1639 The consent by which the spouses mutually give and receive one another is sealed by God 
himself. H2 From their covenant arises “an institution, confirmed by the divine law,... even in the 
eyes of society. ”1H The covenant between the spouses is integrated into God’s covenant with man: 
“Authentic married love is caught up into divine love.”H2 

1640 Thus the marriage bond has been established by God himself in such a way that a marriage 
concluded and consummated between baptized persons can never be dissolved. This bond, which 
results from the free human act of the spouses and their consummation of the marriage, is a reality, 
henceforth irrevocable, and gives rise to a covenant guaranteed by God’s fidelity. The Church does 
not have the power to contravene this disposition of divine wisdom.H2 (2365) 

The grace of the sacrament of Matrimony 

1641 “By reason of their state in life and of their order, [Christian spouses] have their own special 
gifts in the People of God.”Hl This grace proper to the sacrament of Matrimony is intended to 



perfect the couple’s love and to strengthen their indissoluble unity. By this grace they “help one 
another to attain holiness in their married life and in welcoming and educating their children.”!^ 

1642 Christ is the source of this grace. “Just as of old God encountered his people with a covenant 
of love and fidelity, so our Savior, the spouse of the Church, now encounters Christian spouses 
through the sacrament of Matrimony.”^ Christ dwells with them, gives them the strength to take 
up their crosses and so follow him, to rise again after they have fallen, to forgive one another, to 
bear one another’s burdens, to “be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ, ”1^2 and to 
love one another with supernatural, tender, and fruitful love. In the joys of their love and family life 
he gives them here on earth a foretaste of the wedding feast of the Lamb: ( 1615 . 796) 

How can I ever express the happiness of a marriage joined by the Church, strengthened by an 
offering, sealed by a blessing, announced by angels, and ratified by the Father?... How 
wonderful the bond between two believers, now one in hope, one in desire, one in discipline, 
one in the same service! They are both children of one Father and servants of the same Master, 
undivided in spirit and flesh, truly two in one flesh. Where the flesh is one, one also is the 
spirit. 

V. The Goods and Requirements of Conjugal Love 

1643 “Conjugal love involves a totality, in which all the elements of the person enter—appeal of 
the body and instinct, power of feeling and affectivity, aspiration of the spirit and of will. It aims at 
a deeply personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to forming one heart and 
soul; it demands indissolubility and faithfulness in definitive mutual giving; and it is open to 
fertility. In a word it is a question of the normal characteristics of all natural conjugal love, but with 
a new significance which not only purifies and strengthens them, but raises them to the extent of 
making them the expression of specifically Christian values. ”1^2 ( 2361 1 

The unity and indissolubility of marriage 

1644 The love of the spouses requires, of its very nature, the unity and indissolubility of the 
spouses’ community of persons, which embraces their entire life: “so they are no longer two, but 
one flesh.”1^3 They “are called to grow continually in their communion through day-to-day fidelity 
to their marriage promise of total mutual self-giving.”^ This human communion is confirmed, 
purified, and completed by communion in Jesus Christ, given through the sacrament of Matrimony. 
It is deepened by lives of the common faith and by the Eucharist received together. 





1645 “The unity of marriage, distinctly recognized by our Lord, is made clear in the equal personal 
dignity which must be accorded to man and wife in mutual and unreserved affection.”!^ Polygamy 
is contrary to conjugal love which is undivided and exclusive.!^? ( 369 ) 

The fidelity of conjugal love 2364-2365 

1646 By its very nature conjugal love requires the inviolable fidelity of the spouses. This is the 
consequence of the gift of themselves which they make to each other. Love seeks to be definitive; it 
cannot be an arrangement “until further notice.” The “intimate union of marriage, as a mutual 
giving of two persons, and the good of the children, demand total fidelity from the spouses and 
require an unbreakable union between them.”l^Z 

1647 The deepest reason is found in the fidelity of God to his covenant, in that of Christ to his 
Church. Through the sacrament of Matrimony the spouses are enabled to represent this fidelity and 
witness to it. Through the sacrament, the indissolubility of marriage receives a new and deeper 
meaning. 

1648 It can seem difficult, even impossible, to bind oneself for life to another human being. This 
makes it all the more important to proclaim the Good News that God loves us with a definitive and 
irrevocable love, that married couples share in this love, that it supports and sustains them, and that 
by their own faithfulness they can be witnesses to God’s faithful love. Spouses who with God’s 
grace give this witness, often in very difficult conditions, deserve the gratitude and support of the 
ecclesial community.!^ 

1649 Yet there are some situations in which living together becomes practically impossible for a 
variety of reasons. In such cases the Church permits the physical separation of the couple and their 
living apart. The spouses do not cease to be husband and wife before God and so are not free to 
contract a new union. In this difficult situation, the best solution would be, if possible, 
reconciliation. The Christian community is called to help these persons live out their situation in a 
Christian manner and in fidelity to their marriage bond which remains indissoluble.!^ (2383) 

1650 Today there are numerous Catholics in many countries who have recourse to civil divorce and 
contract new civil unions. In fidelity to the words of Jesus Christ — “Whoever divorces his wife 
and marries another, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries 
another, she commits adultery”ihQ —the Church maintains that a new union cannot be recognized 
as valid, if the first marriage was. If the divorced are remarried civilly, they find themselves in a 
situation that objectively contravenes God’s law. Consequently, they cannot receive Eucharistic 





communion as long as this situation persists. For the same reason, they cannot exercise certain 
ecclesial responsibilities. Reconciliation through the sacrament of Penance can be granted only to 
those who have repented for having violated the sign of the covenant and of fidelity to Christ, and 
who are committed to living in complete continence. (2384) 

1651 Toward Christians who live in this situation, and who often keep the faith and desire to bring 
up their children in a Christian manner, priests and the whole community must manifest an 
attentive solicitude, so that they do not consider themselves separated from the Church, in whose 
life they can and must participate as baptized persons: 

They should be encouraged to listen to the Word of God, to attend the Sacrifice of the Mass, to 
persevere in prayer, to contribute to works of charity and to community efforts for justice, to 
bring up their children in the Christian faith, to cultivate the spirit and practice of penance and 
thus implore, day by day, God’s grace. 

The openness to fertility 2366-2367 

1652 “By its very nature the institution of marriage and married love is ordered to the procreation 
and education of the offspring and it is in them that it finds its crowning glory.”lh2 (372) 

Children are the supreme gift of marriage and contribute greatly to the good of the parents 
themselves. God himself said: “It is not good that man should be alone,” and “from the 
beginning [he] made them male and female”; wishing to associate them in a special way in his 
own creative work, God blessed man and woman with the words: “Be fruitful and multiply.” 
Hence, true married love and the whole structure of family life which results from it, without 
diminishment of the other ends of marriage, are directed to disposing the spouses to cooperate 
valiantly with the love of the Creator and Savior, who through them will increase and enrich 
his family from day to day.1^2 

1653 The fruitfulness of conjugal love extends to the fruits of the moral, spiritual, and supernatural 
life that parents hand on to their children by education. Parents are the principal and first educators 
of their children.^ i n this sense the fundamental task of marriage and family is to be at the service 
of life.lh5 ( 2231 ) 

1654 Spouses to whom God has not granted children can nevertheless have a conjugal life full of 
meaning, in both human and Christian terms. Their marriage can radiate a fruitfulness of charity, of 
hospitality, and of sacrifice. 






VI. The Domestic Church 


1655 Christ chose to be born and grow up in the bosom of the holy family of Joseph and Mary. The 
Church is nothing other than “the family of God.” From the beginning, the core of the Church was 
often constituted by those who had become believers “together with all [their] household.”!^ 
When they were converted, they desired that “their whole household” should also be saved.1^2 
These families who became believers were islands of Christian life in an unbelieving world. (759) 

1656 In our own time, in a world often alien and even hostile to faith, believing families are of 
primary importance as centers of living, radiant faith. For this reason the Second Vatican Council, 
using an ancient expression, calls the family the Ecclesia domestica .!§£ It is in the bosom of the 
family that parents are “by word and example... the first heralds of the faith with regard to their 
children. They should encourage them in the vocation which is proper to each child, fostering with 
special care any religious vocation.”!^ ( 2204 ) 

1657 It is here that the father of the family, the mother, children, and all members of the family 
exercise the priesthood of the baptized in a privileged way “by the reception of the sacraments, 
prayer and thanksgiving, the witness of a holy life, and self-denial and active charity.”12Q Thus the 
home is the first school of Christian life and “a school for human enrichment.”!!! Here one learns 
endurance and the joy of work, fraternal love, generous—even repeated—forgiveness, and above 
all divine worship in prayer and the offering of one’s life. [ 1268 . 2214-2231 . 2685 1 

1658 We must also remember the great number of single persons who, because of the particular 
circumstances in which they have to live—often not of their choosing—are especially close to 
Jesus’ heart and therefore deserve the special affection and active solicitude of the Church, 
especially of pastors. Many remain without a human family, often due to conditions of poverty. 
Some live their situation in the spirit of the Beatitudes, serving God and neighbor in exemplary 
fashion. The doors of homes, the “domestic churches,” and of the great family which is the Church 
must be open to all of them. “No one is without a family in this world: the Church is a home and 
family for everyone, especially those who Tabor and are heavy laden . ”’122 [ 2231 . 2233 1 


IN BRIEF 

1659 St. Paul said: “Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the Church.... This is a great 
mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the Church” (Eph 5:25, 32). 












1660 The marriage covenant, by which a man and a woman form with each other an intimate 
communion of life and love, has been founded and endowed with its own special laws by the 
Creator. By its very nature it is ordered to the good of the couple, as well as to the generation and 
education of children. Christ the Lord raised marriage between the baptized to the dignity of a 
sacrament (cf. CIC, can. 1055 § 1; cf. GS 48 § 1). 

1661 The sacrament of Matrimony signifies the union of Christ and the Church. It gives spouses 
the grace to love each other with the love with which Christ has loved his Church; the grace of the 
sacrament thus perfects the human love of the spouses, strengthens their indissoluble unity, and 
sanctifies them on the way to eternal life (cf. Council of Trent: DS 1799). 

1662 Marriage is based on the consent of the contracting parties, that is, on their will to give 
themselves, each to the other, mutually and definitively, in order to live a covenant of faithful and 
fruitful love. 

1663 Since marriage establishes the couple in a public state of life in the Church, it is fitting that its 
celebration be public, in the framework of a liturgical celebration, before the priest (or a witness 
authorized by the Church), the witnesses, and the assembly of the faithful. 

1664 Unity, indissolubility, and openness to fertility are essential to marriage. Polygamy is 
incompatible with the unity of marriage; divorce separates what God has joined together; the 
refusal of fertility turns married life away from its “supreme gift,” the child (GS 50 §1). 

1665 The remarriage of persons divorced from a living, lawful spouse contravenes the plan and law 
of God as taught by Christ. They are not separated from the Church, but they cannot receive 
Eucharistic communion. They will lead Christian lives especially by educating their children in the 
faith. 

1666 The Christian home is the place where children receive the first proclamation of the faith. For 
this reason the family home is rightly called “the domestic church,” a community of grace and 
prayer, a school of human virtues and of Christian charity. 




CHAPTER FOUR 

OTHER LITURGICAL CELEBRATIONS 


ARTICLE 1 

SACRAMENT ALS 

1667 “Holy Mother Church has, moreover, instituted sacramentals. These are sacred signs which 
bear a resemblance to the sacraments. They signify effects, particularly of a spiritual nature, which 
are obtained through the intercession of the Church. By them men are disposed to receive the chief 
effect of the sacraments, and various occasions in life are rendered holy.”i^ 

The characteristics of sacramentals 

1668 Sacramentals are instituted for the sanctification of certain ministries of the Church, certain 
states of life, a great variety of circumstances in Christian life, and the use of many things helpful to 
man. In accordance with bishops’ pastoral decisions, they can also respond to the needs, culture, 
and special history of the Christian people of a particular region or time. They always include a 
prayer, often accompanied by a specific sign, such as the laying on of hands, the sign of the cross, 
or the sprinkling of holy water (which recalls Baptism). (699, 2157 1 

1669 Sacramentals derive from the baptismal priesthood: every baptized person is called to be a 
“blessing,” and to bless.d^4 Hence lay people may preside at certain blessings; the more a blessing 
concerns ecclesial and sacramental life, the more is its administration reserved to the ordained 
ministry (bishops, priests, or deacons).!^ (784 . 2626 1 

1670 Sacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the way that the sacraments do, but 
by the Church’s prayer, they prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it. “For 
well-disposed members of the faithful, the liturgy of the sacraments and sacramentals sanctifies 
almost every event of their lives with the divine grace which flows from the Paschal mystery of the 
Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Christ. From this source all sacraments and sacramentals draw 
their power. There is scarcely any proper use of material things which cannot be thus directed 
toward the sanctification of men and the praise of God.”l^ ( 1128 . 2001) 

Various forms of sacramentals 

1671 Among sacramentals blessings (of persons, meals, objects, and places) come first. Every 
blessing praises God and prays for his gifts. In Christ, Christians are blessed by God the Father 








“with every spiritual blessing.”!!! This is why the Church imparts blessings by invoking the name 
of Jesus, usually while making the holy sign of the cross of Christ. ( 1078 ) 


1672 Certain blessings have a lasting importance because they consecrate persons to God, or 
reserve objects and places for liturgical use. Among those blessings which are intended for persons 
—not to be confused with sacramental ordination—are the blessing of the abbot or abbess of a 
monastery, the consecration of virgins and widows, the rite of religious profession and the blessing 
of certain ministries of the Church (readers, acolytes, catechists, etc.). The dedication or blessing of 
a church or an altar, the blessing of holy oils, vessels, and vestments, bells, etc., can be mentioned 
as examples of blessings that concern objects. (923, 925, 903) 

1673 When the Church asks publicly and authoritatively in the name of Jesus Christ that a person 
or object be protected against the power of the Evil One and withdrawn from his dominion, it is 
called exorcism. Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power and 
office of exorcizing.!^ a simple form, exorcism is performed at the celebration of Baptism. The 
solemn exorcism, called “a major exorcism,” can be performed only by a priest and with the 
permission of the bishop. The priest must proceed with prudence, strictly observing the rules 
established by the Church. Exorcism is directed at the expulsion of demons or to the liberation from 
demonic possession through the spiritual authority which Jesus entrusted to his Church. Illness, 
especially psychological illness, is a very different matter; treating this is the concern of medical 
science. Therefore, before an exorcism is performed, it is important to ascertain that one is dealing 
with the presence of the Evil One, and not an illness.!^ ( 395 , 550, 1237 1 

Popular piety 

1674 Besides sacramental liturgy and sacramentals, catechesis must take into account the forms of 
piety and popular devotions among the faithful. The religious sense of the Christian people has 
always found expression in various forms of piety surrounding the Church’s sacramental life, such 
as the veneration of relics, visits to sanctuaries, pilgrimages, processions, the stations of the cross, 
religious dances, the rosary, medals, !^2 etc. ( 2688 . 2669 . 2678 1 

1675 These expressions of piety extend the liturgical life of the Church, but do not replace it. They 
“should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred 
liturgy, are in some way derived from it and lead the people to it, since in fact the liturgy by its very 
nature is far superior to any of them.”!^! 

1676 Pastoral discernment is needed to sustain and support popular piety and, if necessary, to 












purify and correct the religious sense which underlies these devotions so that the faithful may 
advance in knowledge of the mystery of Christ. 1^2 Their exercise is subject to the care and 
judgment of the bishops and to the general norms of the Church. (426) 

At its core the piety of the people is a storehouse of values that offers answers of Christian 
wisdom to the great questions of life. The Catholic wisdom of the people is capable of 
fashioning a vital synthesis.... It creatively combines the divine and the human, Christ and 
Mary, spirit and body, communion and institution, person and community, faith and 
homeland, intelligence and emotion. This wisdom is a Christian humanism that radically 
affirms the dignity of every person as a child of God, establishes a basic fraternity, teaches 
people to encounter nature and understand work, provides reasons for joy and humor even in 
the midst of a very hard life. For the people this wisdom is also a principle of discernment and 
an evangelical instinct through which they spontaneously sense when the Gospel is served in 
the Church and when it is emptied of its content and stifled by other interests.!^ 


IN BRIEF 

1677 Sacramentals are sacred signs instituted by the Church. They prepare men to receive the fruit 
of the sacraments and sanctify different circumstances of life. 

1678 Among the sacramentals blessings occupy an important place. They include both praise of 
God for his works and gifts, and the Church’s intercession for men that they may be able to use 
God’s gifts according to the spirit of the Gospel. 

1679 In addition to the liturgy, Christian life is nourished by various forms of popular piety, rooted 
in the different cultures. While carefully clarifying them in the light of faith, the Church fosters the 
forms of popular piety that express an evangelical instinct and a human wisdom and that enrich 
Christian life. 


ARTICLE 2 

CHRISTIAN FUNERALS 


1680 All the sacraments, and principally those of Christian initiation, have as their goal the last 
Passover of the child of God which, through death, leads him into the life of the Kingdom. Then 









what he confessed in faith and hope will be fulfilled: “I look for the resurrection of the dead, and 
the life of the world to come/’d^ (1525) 


I. The Christian’s Last Passover 

1681 The Christian meaning of death is revealed in the light of the Paschal mystery of the death 
and resurrection of Christ in whom resides our only hope. The Christian who dies in Christ Jesus is 
“away from the body and at home with the Lord.”l^ ( 1010-1014 ! 

1682 For the Christian the day of death inaugurates, at the end of his sacramental life, the 
fulfillment of his new birth begun at Baptism, the definitive “conformity” to “the image of the Son” 
conferred by the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and participation in the feast of the Kingdom which 
was anticipated in the Eucharist—even if final purifications are still necessary for him in order to 
be clothed with the nuptial garment. 

1683 The Church who, as Mother, has borne the Christian sacramentally in her womb during his 
earthly pilgrimage, accompanies him at his journey’s end, in order to surrender him “into the 
Father’s hands.” She offers to the Father, in Christ, the child of his grace, and she commits to the 
earth, in hope, the seed of the body that will rise in glory.d^ This offering is fully celebrated in the 
Eucharistic sacrifice; the blessings before and after Mass are sacramentals. ( 1020 . 627 ! 

II. The Celebration of Funerals 

1684 The Christian funeral is a liturgical celebration of the Church. The ministry of the Church in 
this instance aims at expressing efficacious communion with the deceased, at the participation in 
that communion of the community gathered for the funeral, and at the proclamation of eternal life to 
the community. 

1685 The different funeral rites express the Paschal character of Christian death and are in keeping 
with the situations and traditions of each region, even as to the color of the liturgical vestments 

worn.TC 


1686 The Order of Christian Funerals (Ordo exsequiarum ) of the Roman liturgy gives three types 
of funeral celebrations, corresponding to the three places in which they are conducted (the home, 
the church, and the cemetery), and according to the importance attached to them by the family, 
local customs, the culture, and popular piety. This order of celebration is common to all the 
liturgical traditions and comprises four principal elements: 







1687 The greeting of the community. A greeting of faith begins the celebration. Relatives and 
friends of the deceased are welcomed with a word of “consolation” (in the New Testament sense of 
the Holy Spirit’s power in hope). 122 The community assembling in prayer also awaits the “words 
of eternal life.” The death of a member of the community (or the anniversary of a death, or the 
seventh or thirtieth day after death) is an event that should lead beyond the perspectives of “this 
world” and should draw the faithful into the true perspective of faith in the risen Christ. 

1688 The liturgy of the Word during funerals demands very careful preparation because the 
assembly present for the funeral may include some faithful who rarely attend the liturgy, and 
friends of the deceased who are not Christians. The homily in particular must “avoid the literary 
genre of funeral eulogy”122 and illumine the mystery of Christian death in the light of the risen 
Christ. 

1689 The Eucharistic Sacrifice. When the celebration takes place in church, the Eucharist is the 
heart of the Paschal reality of Christian death.122 In the Eucharist, the Church expresses her 
efficacious communion with the departed: offering to the Father in the Holy Spirit the sacrifice of 
the death and resurrection of Christ, she asks to purify his child of his sins and their consequences, 
and to admit him to the Paschal fullness of the table of the Kingdom.^ It is by the Eucharist thus 
celebrated that the community of the faithful, especially the family of the deceased, learn to live in 
communion with the one who “has fallen asleep in the Lord,” by communicating in the Body of 
Christ of which he is a living member and, then, by praying for him and with him. ( 1371 . 958 ) 

1690 A farewell to the deceased is his final “commendation to God” by the Church. It is “the last 
farewell by which the Christian community greets one of its members before his body is brought to 
its tomb. ”122 The Byzantine tradition expresses this by the kiss of farewell to the deceased: (2300) 

By this final greeting “we sing for his departure from this life and separation from us, but also 
because there is a communion and a reunion. For even dead, we are not at all separated from 
one another, because we all run the same course and we will find one another again in the 
same place. We shall never be separated, for we live for Christ, and now we are united with 
Christ as we go toward him... we shall all be together in Christ.”122

PART THREE 
LIFE IN CHRIST 


1691 “Christian, recognize your dignity and, now that you share in God’s own nature, do not return 
to your former base condition by sinning. Remember who is your head and of whose body you are 
a member. Never forget that you have been rescued from the power of darkness and brought into 
the light of the Kingdom of God.”l (790) 

1692 The Symbol of the faith confesses the greatness of God’s gifts to man in his work of creation, 
and even more in redemption and sanctification. What faith confesses, the sacraments 
communicate: by the sacraments of rebirth, Christians have become “children of God, ”2 “partakers 
of the divine nature. ”2 Coming to see in the faith their new dignity, Christians are called to lead 
henceforth a life “worthy of the gospel of Christ.”! They are made capable of doing so by the grace 
of Christ and the gifts of his Spirit, which they receive through the sacraments and through prayer. 

1693 Christ Jesus always did what was pleasing to the Father ^ and always lived in perfect 
communion with him. Likewise Christ’s disciples are invited to live in the sight of the Father “who 
sees in secret,in order to become “perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.”! 

1694 Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, Christians are “dead to sin and alive to God in Christ 
Jesus” and so participate in the life of the Risen Lord.^ Following Christ and united with him, 2 
Christians can strive to be “imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love”lQ by 
conforming their thoughts, words and actions to the “mind... which is yours in Christ Jesus, ”H and 
by following his example.!! (1267 ) 

1695 “Justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God,”H “sanctified... 
[and] called to be saints, ”14 Christians have become the temple of the Holy Spirit .15 This “Spirit of 
the Son” teaches them to pray to the Fatherlh and, having become their life, prompts them to act so 
as to bear “the fruit of the Spirit”!! by charity in action. Healing the wounds of sin, the Holy Spirit 
renews us interiorly through a spiritual transformation.!^ He enlightens and strengthens us to live 
as “children of light” through “all that is good and right and true.”!^ 

1696 The way of Christ “leads to life”; a contrary way “leads to destruction.”!^ The Gospel parable 
of the two ways remains ever present in the catechesis of the Church; it shows the importance of 
moral decisions for our salvation: “There are two ways, the one of life, the other of death; but 




between the two, there is a great difference. ”21 (1970) 


1697 Catechesis has to reveal in all clarity the joy and the demands of the way of Christ.22 
Catechesis for the “newness of life”23 in him should be: ( 737 . 1988 . 1716 . 1846 . 1803 . 1812 . 2067 . 
946) 

—a catechesis of the Holy Spirit, the interior Master of life according to Christ, a gentle guest 
and friend who inspires, guides, corrects, and strengthens this life; 

—a catechesis of grace, for it is by grace that we are saved and again it is by grace that our 
works can bear fruit for eternal life; 

—a catechesis of the beatitudes, for the way of Christ is summed up in the beatitudes, the only 
path that leads to the eternal beatitude for which the human heart longs; 

—a catechesis of sin and forgiveness, for unless man acknowledges that he is a sinner he 
cannot know the truth about himself, which is a condition for acting justly; and without the 
offer of forgiveness he would not be able to bear this truth; 

—a catechesis of the human virtues which causes one to grasp the beauty and attraction of right 
dispositions towards goodness; 

—a catechesis of the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and charity, generously inspired by the 
example of the saints; 

—a catechesis of the twofold commandment of charity set forth in the Decalogue; 

—an ecclesial catechesis, for it is through the manifold exchanges of “spiritual goods” in the 
“communion of saints” that Christian life can grow, develop, and be communicated. 

1698 The first and last point of reference of this catechesis will always be Jesus Christ himself, who 
is “the way, and the truth, and the life. ”24 it is by looking to him in faith that Christ’s faithful can 
hope that he himself fulfills his promises in them, and that, by loving him with the same love with 
which he has loved them, they may perform works in keeping with their dignity: (426) 

I ask you to consider that our Lord Jesus Christ is your true head, and that you are one of his 
members. He belongs to you as the head belongs to its members; all that is his is yours: his 
spirit, his heart, his body and soul, and all his faculties. You must make use of all these as of 
your own, to serve, praise, love, and glorify God. You belong to him, as members belong to 
their head. And so he longs for you to use all that is in you, as if it were his own, for the 
service and glory of the Father. 25 

For to me, to live is Christ.2h

SECTION ONE 
MAN’S VOCATION 
LIFE IN THE SPIRIT 


1699 Life in the Holy Spirit fulfills the vocation of man ( chapter one ). This life is made up of 
divine charity and human solidarity ( chapter two ). It is graciously offered as salvation ( chapter 
three ). 






CHAPTER ONE 

THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON 


1700 The dignity of the human person is rooted in his creation in the image and likeness of God 
(article 1); it is fulfilled in his vocation to divine beatitude (article 2). It is essential to a human 
being freely to direct himself to this fulfillment (article 3). By his deliberate actions (article 4), the 
human person does, or does not, conform to the good promised by God and attested by moral 
conscience (article 5). Human beings make their own contribution to their interior growth; they 
make their whole sentient and spiritual lives into means of this growth (article 6). With the help of 
grace they grow in virtue (article 7), avoid sin, and if they sin they entrust themselves as did the 
prodigal son 2 to the mercy of our Father in heaven (article 8). In this way they attain to the 
perfection of charity. ( 356 . 1439 1 

ARTICLE 1 

MAN: THE IMAGE OF GOD 


1701 “Christ,... in the very revelation of the mystery of the Father and of his love, makes man fully 
manifest to himself and brings to light his exalted vocation.” 2 It is in Christ, “the image of the 
invisible God, ”2 that man has been created “in the image and likeness” of the Creator. It is in 
Christ, Redeemer and Savior, that the divine image, disfigured in man by the first sin, has been 
restored to its original beauty and ennobled by the grace of God. 2 (359) 

1702 The divine image is present in every man. It shines forth in the communion of persons, in the 
likeness of the unity of the divine persons among themselves (cf. chapter two ). ( 1878 1 

1703 Endowed with “a spiritual and immortal” soul,^ the human person is “the only creature on 
earth that God has willed for its own sake.”§ From his conception, he is destined for eternal 
beatitude. ( 363 . 2258 1 

1704 The human person participates in the light and power of the divine Spirit. By his reason, he is 
capable of understanding the order of things established by the Creator. By free will, he is capable 
of directing himself toward his true good. He finds his perfection “in seeking and loving what is 
true and good.” 2 (339, 30) 


1705 By virtue of his soul and his spiritual powers of intellect and will, man is endowed with 












freedom, an “outstanding manifestation of the divine image. (1730) 


1706 By his reason, man recognizes the voice of God which urges him “to do what is good and 
avoid what is evil. ”3 Everyone is obliged to follow this law, which makes itself heard in conscience 
and is fulfilled in the love of God and of neighbor. Living a moral life bears witness to the dignity 
of the person. ( 1776 ) 

1707 “Man, enticed by the Evil One, abused his freedom at the very beginning of history.”^ He 
succumbed to temptation and did what was evil. He still desires the good, but his nature bears the 
wound of original sin. He is now inclined to evil and subject to error: ( 397 ) 

Man is divided in himself. As a result, the whole life of men, both individual and social, shows 
itself to be a struggle, and a dramatic one, between good and evil, between light and 
darkness.Jd 

1708 By his Passion, Christ delivered us from Satan and from sin. He merited for us the new life in 
the Holy Spirit. His grace restores what sin had damaged in us. (617) 

1709 He who believes in Christ becomes a son of God. This filial adoption transforms him by 
giving him the ability to follow the example of Christ. It makes him capable of acting rightly and 
doing good. In union with his Savior, the disciple attains the perfection of charity which is holiness. 
Having matured in grace, the moral life blossoms into eternal life in the glory of heaven. ( 1265 . 
1050 1 


IN BRIEF 

1710 “Christ... makes man fully manifest to man himself and brings to light his exalted vocation” 
(GS 22 § 1). 

1711 Endowed with a spiritual soul, with intellect and with free will, the human person is from his 
very conception ordered to God and destined for eternal beatitude. He pursues his perfection in 
“seeking and loving what is true and good” (GS 15 § 2). 

1712 In man, true freedom is an “outstanding manifestation of the divine image” (GS 17). 

1713 Man is obliged to follow the moral law, which urges him “to do what is good and avoid what 










is evil” (cf. GS 16). This law makes itself heard in his conscience. 


1714 Man, having been wounded in his nature by original sin, is subject to error and inclined to evil 
in exercising his freedom. 

1715 He who believes in Christ has new life in the Holy Spirit. The moral life, increased and 
brought to maturity in grace, is to reach its fulfillment in the glory of heaven. 


ARTICLE 2 

OUR VOCATION TO BEATITUDE 


I. The Beatitudes 

1716 The Beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus’ preaching. They take up the promises made to the 
chosen people since Abraham. The Beatitudes fulfill the promises by ordering them no longer 
merely to the possession of a territory, but to the Kingdom of heaven: (2546) 

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. 

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. 

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, 
for they shall be satisfied. 

Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. 

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. 

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. 

Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, 
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 

Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you 
and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. 

Rejoice and be glad, 

for your reward is great in heaven. -2 

1717 The Beatitudes depict the countenance of Jesus Christ and portray his charity. They express 
the vocation of the faithful associated with the glory of his Passion and Resurrection; they shed 
light on the actions and attitudes characteristic of the Christian life; they are the paradoxical 








promises that sustain hope in the midst of tribulations; they proclaim the blessings and rewards 
already secured, however dimly, for Christ’s disciples; they have begun in the lives of the Virgin 
Mary and all the saints. ( 459 . 1820 1 

II. The Desire for Happiness 

1718 The Beatitudes respond to the natural desire for happiness. This desire is of divine origin: 
God has placed it in the human heart in order to draw man to the One who alone can fulfill it: (27, 
1024 . 2541) 

We all want to live happily; in the whole human race there is no one who does not assent to 
this proposition, even before it is fully articulated.^ 

How is it, then, that I seek you, Lord? Since in seeking you, my God, I seek a happy life, let 
me seek you so that my soul may live, for my body draws life from my soul and my soul 
draws life from you.14 

God alone satisfies.!^ 

1719 The Beatitudes reveal the goal of human existence, the ultimate end of human acts: God calls 
us to his own beatitude. This vocation is addressed to each individual personally, but also to the 
Church as a whole, the new people made up of those who have accepted the promise and live from 
it in faith. (1950) 

III. Christian Beatitude 

1720 The New Testament uses several expressions to characterize the beatitude to which God calls 
man: (1027 ) 

—the coming of the Kingdom of God;l^ 

—the vision of God: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God”;12 
—entering into the joy of the Lord;l^ 

—entering into God’s rest:i2 

There we shall rest and see, we shall see and love, we shall love and praise. Behold what will 
be at the end without end. For what other end do we have, if not to reach the kingdom which 
has no end?^ 








1721 God put us in the world to know, to love, and to serve him, and so to come to paradise. 
Beatitude makes us “partakers of the divine nature” and of eternal life.2-1 With beatitude, man 
enters into the glory of Christ^ and into the joy of the Trinitarian life. ( 260 1 

1722 Such beatitude surpasses the understanding and powers of man. It comes from an entirely free 
gift of God: whence it is called supernatural, as is the grace that disposes man to enter into the 
divine joy. (1028 . 294 1 

“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” It is true, because of the greatness and 
inexpressible glory of God, that “man shall not see me and live,” for the Father cannot be 
grasped. But because of God’s love and goodness toward us, and because he can do all things, 
he goes so far as to grant those who love him the privilege of seeing him.... For “what is 
impossible for men is possible for God.”^ 

1723 The beatitude we are promised confronts us with decisive moral choices. It invites us to 
purify our hearts of bad instincts and to seek the love of God above all else. It teaches us that true 
happiness is not found in riches or well-being, in human fame or power, or in any human 
achievement—however beneficial it may be—such as science, technology, and art, or indeed in any 
creature, but in God alone, the source of every good and of all love: ( 2519 . 227) 

All bow down before wealth. Wealth is that to which the multitude of men pay an instinctive 
homage. They measure happiness by wealth; and by wealth they measure respectability.... It is 
a homage resulting from a profound faith... that with wealth he may do all things. Wealth is 
one idol of the day and notoriety is a second.... Notoriety, or the making of a noise in the 
world—it may be called “newspaper fame” — has come to be considered a great good in 
itself, and a ground of veneration.^ 

1724 The Decalogue, the Sermon on the Mount, and the apostolic catechesis describe for us the 
paths that lead to the Kingdom of heaven. Sustained by the grace of the Holy Spirit, we tread them, 
step by step, by everyday acts. By the working of the Word of Christ, we slowly bear fruit in the 
Church to the glory of God.^ 


IN BRIEF 


1725 The Beatitudes take up and fulfill God’s promises from Abraham by ordering them to the 










Kingdom of heaven. They respond to the desire for happiness that God has placed in the human 
heart. 

1726 The Beatitudes teach us the final end to which God calls us: the Kingdom, the vision of God, 
participation in the divine nature, eternal life, filiation, rest in God. 

1727 The beatitude of eternal life is a gratuitous gift of God. It is supernatural, as is the grace that 
leads us there. 

1728 The Beatitudes confront us with decisive choices concerning earthly goods; they purify our 
hearts in order to teach us to love God above all things. 

1729 The beatitude of heaven sets the standards for discernment in the use of earthly goods in 
keeping with the law of God. 


ARTICLE 3 

MAN’S FREEDOM 


1730 God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate 
and control his own actions. “God willed that man should be ‘left in the hand of his own counsel,’ 
so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection 
by cleaving to him.”^ (30) 

Man is rational and therefore like God; he is created with free will and is master over his 
acts.^? 


I. Freedom and Responsibility 

1731 Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will, to act or not to act, to do this or that, and so 
to perform deliberate actions on one’s own responsibility. By free will one shapes one’s own life. 
Human freedom is a force for growth and maturity in truth and goodness; it attains its perfection 
when directed toward God, our beatitude. ( 1721 1 

1732 As long as freedom has not bound itself definitively to its ultimate good which is God, there 
is the possibility of choosing between good and evil, and thus of growing in perfection or of failing 
and sinning. This freedom characterizes properly human acts. It is the basis of praise or blame, 








merit or reproach. (396, 1849 . 2006) 


1733 The more one does what is good, the freer one becomes. There is no true freedom except in 
the service of what is good and just. The choice to disobey and do evil is an abuse of freedom and 
leads to “the slavery of sin. ”22 ( 1803 ) 

1734 Freedom makes man responsible for his acts to the extent that they are voluntary. Progress in 
virtue, knowledge of the good, and ascesis enhance the mastery of the will over its acts. ( 1036 . 
1804 1 

1735 Imputability and responsibility for an action can be diminished or even nullified by ignorance, 
inadvertence, duress, fear, habit, inordinate attachments, and other psychological or social factors. 
(597) 

1736 Every act directly willed is imputable to its author: ( 2568 ) 

Thus the Lord asked Eve after the sin in the garden: “What is this that you have done?”22 He 
asked Cain the same question.22 The prophet Nathan questioned David in the same way after he 
committed adultery with the wife of Uriah and had him murdered.^! 

An action can be indirectly voluntary when it results from negligence regarding something one 
should have known or done: for example, an accident arising from ignorance of traffic laws. 

1737 An effect can be tolerated without being willed by its agent; for instance, a mother’s 
exhaustion from tending her sick child. A bad effect is not imputable if it was not willed either as 
an end or as a means of an action, e.g., a death a person incurs in aiding someone in danger. For a 
bad effect to be imputable it must be foreseeable and the agent must have the possibility of 
avoiding it, as in the case of manslaughter caused by a drunken driver. (2263) 

1738 Freedom is exercised in relationships between human beings. Every human person, created in 
the image of God, has the natural right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All owe to 
each other this duty of respect. The right to the exercise of freedom, especially in moral and 
religious matters, is an inalienable requirement of the dignity of the human person. This right must 
be recognized and protected by civil authority within the limits of the common good and public 
order.22 (2106, 2109 1 

II. Human Freedom in the Economy of Salvation 


1739 Freedom and sin. Man’s freedom is limited and fallible. In fact, man failed. He freely sinned. 













By refusing God’s plan of love, he deceived himself and became a slave to sin. This first alienation 
engendered a multitude of others. From its outset, human history attests the wretchedness and 
oppression born of the human heart in consequence of the abuse of freedom. (387, 401) 

1740 Threats to freedom. The exercise of freedom does not imply a right to say or do everything. It 
is false to maintain that man, “the subject of this freedom,” is “an individual who is fully self- 
sufficient and whose finality is the satisfaction of his own interests in the enjoyment of earthly 
goods. ”22 Moreover, the economic, social, political, and cultural conditions that are needed for a 
just exercise of freedom are too often disregarded or violated. Such situations of blindness and 
injustice injure the moral life and involve the strong as well as the weak in the temptation to sin 
against charity. By deviating from the moral law man violates his own freedom, becomes 
imprisoned within himself, disrupts neighborly fellowship, and rebels against divine truth. 1 2108 . 
1887 1 

1741 Liberation and salvation. By his glorious Cross Christ has won salvation for all men. He 
redeemed them from the sin that held them in bondage. “For freedom Christ has set us free. ”24 In 
him we have communion with the “truth that makes us free. ”25 The Holy Spirit has been given to 
us and, as the Apostle teaches, “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.”2b Already we 
glory in the “liberty of the children of God. ”27 (782) 

1742 Freedom and grace. The grace of Christ is not in the slightest way a rival of our freedom 
when this freedom accords with the sense of the true and the good that God has put in the human 
heart. On the contrary, as Christian experience attests especially in prayer, the more docile we are 
to the promptings of grace, the more we grow in inner freedom and confidence during trials, such 
as those we face in the pressures and constraints of the outer world. By the working of grace the 
Holy Spirit educates us in spiritual freedom in order to make us free collaborators in his work in the 
Church and in the world: 12002 . 1784 1 

Almighty and merciful God, 

in your goodness take away from us all that is harmful, 

so that, made ready both in mind and body, 

we may freely accomplish your will.— 


IN BRIEF 











1743 “God willed that man should be left in the hand of his own counsel (cf. Sir 15:14), so that he 
might of his own accord seek his creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by 
cleaving to him” (GS 17 § 1). 

1744 Freedom is the power to act or not to act, and so to perform deliberate acts of one’s own. 
Freedom attains perfection in its acts when directed toward God, the sovereign Good. 

1745 Freedom characterizes properly human acts. It makes the human being responsible for acts of 
which he is the voluntary agent. His deliberate acts properly belong to him. 

1746 The imputability or responsibility for an action can be diminished or nullified by ignorance, 
duress, fear, and other psychological or social factors. 

1747 The right to the exercise of freedom, especially in religious and moral matters, is an 
inalienable requirement of the dignity of man. But the exercise of freedom does not entail the 
putative right to say or do anything. 

1748 “For freedom Christ has set us free” (Gal 5:1). 


ARTICLE 4 

THE MORALITY OF HUMAN ACTS 


1749 Freedom makes man a moral subject. When he acts deliberately, man is, so to speak, the 
father of his acts. Human acts, that is, acts that are freely chosen in consequence of a judgment of 
conscience, can be morally evaluated. They are either good or evil. (1732) 

I. The Sources of Morality 

1750 The morality of human acts depends on: 

—the object chosen; 

—the end in view or the intention; 

—the circumstances of the action. 

The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the “sources,” or constitutive 
elements, of the morality of human acts. 







1751 The object chosen is a good toward which the will deliberately directs itself. It is the matter of 
a human act. The object chosen morally specifies the act of the will, insofar as reason recognizes 
and judges it to be or not to be in conformity with the true good. Objective norms of morality 
express the rational order of good and evil, attested to by conscience. (1794) 

1752 In contrast to the object, the intention resides in the acting subject. Because it lies at the 
voluntary source of an action and determines it by its end, intention is an element essential to the 
moral evaluation of an action. The end is the first goal of the intention and indicates the purpose 
pursued in the action. The intention is a movement of the will toward the end: it is concerned with 
the goal of the activity. It aims at the good anticipated from the action undertaken. Intention is not 
limited to directing individual actions, but can guide several actions toward one and the same 
purpose; it can orient one’s whole life toward its ultimate end. For example, a service done with the 
end of helping one’s neighbor can at the same time be inspired by the love of God as the ultimate 
end of all our actions. One and the same action can also be inspired by several intentions, such as 
performing a service in order to obtain a favor or to boast about it. (2520, 1731 1 

1753 A good intention (for example, that of helping one’s neighbor) does not make behavior that is 
intrinsically disordered, such as lying and calumny, good or just. The end does not justify the 
means. Thus the condemnation of an innocent person cannot be justified as a legitimate means of 
saving the nation. On the other hand, an added bad intention (such as vainglory) makes an act evil 
that, in and of itself, can be good (such as almsgiving).^ ( 2479 . 596 ) 

1754 The circumstances, including the consequences, are secondary elements of a moral act. They 
contribute to increasing or diminishing the moral goodness or evil of human acts (for example, the 
amount of a theft). They can also diminish or increase the agent’s responsibility (such as acting out 
of a fear of death). Circumstances of themselves cannot change the moral quality of acts 
themselves; they can make neither good nor right an action that is in itself evil. (1735) 

II. Good Acts and Evil Acts 

1755 A morally good act requires the goodness of the object, of the end, and of the circumstances 
together. An evil end corrupts the action, even if the object is good in itself (such as praying and 
fasting “in order to be seen by men”). 

The object of the choice can by itself vitiate an act in its entirety. There are some concrete acts— 
such as fornication—that it is always wrong to choose, because choosing them entails a disorder of 
the will, that is, a moral evil. 








1756 It is therefore an error to judge the morality of human acts by considering only the intention 
that inspires them or the circumstances (environment, social pressure, duress or emergency, etc.) 
which supply their context. There are acts which, in and of themselves, independently of 
circumstances and intentions, are always gravely illicit by reason of their object; such as blasphemy 
and perjury, murder and adultery. One may not do evil so that good may result from it. (1789) 


IN BRIEF 

1757 The object, the intention, and the circumstances make up the three “sources” of the morality 
of human acts. 

1758 The object chosen morally specifies the act of willing accordingly as reason recognizes and 
judges it good or evil. 

1759 “An evil action cannot be justified by reference to a good intention” (cf. St. Thomas Aquinas, 
Dec. praec. 6). The end does not justify the means. 

1760 A morally good act requires the goodness of its object, of its end, and of its circumstances 
together. 

1761 There are concrete acts that it is always wrong to choose, because their choice entails a 
disorder of the will, i.e., a moral evil. One may not do evil so that good may result from it. 


ARTICLE 5 

THE MORALITY OF THE PASSIONS 


1762 The human person is ordered to beatitude by his deliberate acts: the passions or feelings he 
experiences can dispose him to it and contribute to it. 

I. Passions 

1763 The term “passions” belongs to the Christian patrimony. Feelings or passions are emotions or 
movements of the sensitive appetite that incline us to act or not to act in regard to something felt or 
imagined to be good or evil. 










1764 The passions are natural components of the human psyche; they form the passageway and 
ensure the connection between the life of the senses and the life of the mind. Our Lord called man’s 
heart the source from which the passions spring.42 (368) 

1765 There are many passions. The most fundamental passion is love, aroused by the attraction of 
the good. Love causes a desire for the absent good and the hope of obtaining it; this movement 
finds completion in the pleasure and joy of the good possessed. The apprehension of evil causes 
hatred, aversion, and fear of the impending evil; this movement ends in sadness at some present 
evil, or in the anger that resists it. 

1766 “To love is to will the good of another.’’^! All other affections have their source in this first 
movement of the human heart toward the good. Only the good can be loved.42 Passions “are evil if 
love is evil and good if it is good.”43 ( 1704 ) 

II. Passions and Moral Life 

1767 In themselves passions are neither good nor evil. They are morally qualified only to the extent 
that they effectively engage reason and will. Passions are said to be voluntary, “either because they 
are commanded by the will or because the will does not place obstacles in their way.”44 it belongs 
to the perfection of the moral or human good that the passions be governed by reason.^ ( 1860 1 

1768 Strong feelings are not decisive for the morality or the holiness of persons; they are simply 
the inexhaustible reservoir of images and affections in which the moral life is expressed. Passions 
are morally good when they contribute to a good action, evil in the opposite case. The upright will 
orders the movements of the senses it appropriates to the good and to beatitude; an evil will 
succumbs to disordered passions and exacerbates them. Emotions and feelings can be taken up into 
the virtues or perverted by the vices. ( 1803 . 1865 1 

1769 In the Christian life, the Holy Spirit himself accomplishes his work by mobilizing the whole 
being, with all its sorrows, fears and sadness, as is visible in the Lord’s agony and passion. In 
Christ human feelings are able to reach their consummation in charity and divine beatitude. 

1770 Moral perfection consists in man’s being moved to the good not by his will alone, but also by 
his sensitive appetite, as in the words of the psalm: “My heart and flesh sing for joy to the living 
God.”4b (30) 










IN BRIEF 


1771 The term “passions” refers to the affections or the feelings. By his emotions man intuits the 
good and suspects evil. 

1772 The principal passions are love and hatred, desire and fear, joy, sadness, and anger. 

1773 In the passions, as movements of the sensitive appetite, there is neither moral good nor evil. 
But insofar as they engage reason and will, there is moral good or evil in them. 

1774 Emotions and feelings can be taken up in the virtues or perverted by the vices. 

1775 The perfection of the moral good consists in man’s being moved to the good not only by his 
will but also by his “heart.” 


ARTICLE 6 

MORAL CONSCIENCE 


1776 “Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but 
which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, 
sounds in his heart at the right moment.... For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God.... His 
conscience is man’s most secret core and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice 
echoes in his depths.”4Z (1954) 

I. The Judgment of Conscience 

1777 Moral conscience,^ present at the heart of the person, enjoins him at the appropriate moment 
to do good and to avoid evil. It also judges particular choices, approving those that are good and 
denouncing those that are evil .42 It bears witness to the authority of truth in reference to the 
supreme Good to which the human person is drawn, and it welcomes the commandments. When he 
listens to his conscience, the prudent man can hear God speaking. ( 1766 . 2071 ) 

1778 Conscience is a judgment of reason whereby the human person recognizes the moral quality 
of a concrete act that he is going to perform, is in the process of performing, or has already 
completed. In all he says and does, man is obliged to follow faithfully what he knows to be just and 
right. It is by the judgment of his conscience that man perceives and recognizes the prescriptions of 









the divine law: (1749 1 


Conscience is a law of the mind; yet [Christians] would not grant that it is nothing more; I 
mean that it was not a dictate, nor conveyed the notion of responsibility, of duty, of a threat 
and a promise.... [Conscience] is a messenger of him, who, both in nature and in grace, speaks 
to us behind a veil, and teaches and rules us by his representatives. Conscience is the 
aboriginal Vicar of Christ.^O 

1779 It is important for every person to be sufficiently present to himself in order to hear and 
follow the voice of his conscience. This requirement of interiority is all the more necessary as life 
often distracts us from any reflection, self-examination or introspection: ( 1886 1 

Return to your conscience, question it.... Turn inward, brethren, and in everything you do, see 
God as your witness.^ 

1780 The dignity of the human person implies and requires uprightness of moral conscience. 
Conscience includes the perception of the principles of morality (synderesis); their application in 
the given circumstances by practical discernment of reasons and goods; and finally judgment about 
concrete acts yet to be performed or already performed. The truth about the moral good, stated in 
the law of reason, is recognized practically and concretely by the prudent judgment of conscience. 
We call that man prudent who chooses in conformity with this judgment. ( 1806 1 

1781 Conscience enables one to assume responsibility for the acts performed. If man commits evil, 
the just judgment of conscience can remain within him as the witness to the universal truth of the 
good, at the same time as the evil of his particular choice. The verdict of the judgment of 
conscience remains a pledge of hope and mercy. In attesting to the fault committed, it calls to mind 
the forgiveness that must be asked, the good that must still be practiced, and the virtue that must be 
constantly cultivated with the grace of God: ( 1731 1 

We shall... reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater 
than our hearts, and he knows everything.^ 

1782 Man has the right to act in conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral 
decisions. “He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from 
acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters.”^ ( 2106 1 


II. The Formation of Conscience 







1783 Conscience must be informed and moral judgment enlightened. A well-formed conscience is 
upright and truthful. It formulates its judgments according to reason, in conformity with the true 
good willed by the wisdom of the Creator. The education of conscience is indispensable for human 
beings who are subjected to negative influences and tempted by sin to prefer their own judgment 
and to reject authoritative teachings. (2039) 

1784 The education of the conscience is a lifelong task. From the earliest years, it awakens the 
child to the knowledge and practice of the interior law recognized by conscience. Prudent education 
teaches virtue; it prevents or cures fear, selfishness and pride, resentment arising from guilt, and 
feelings of complacency, born of human weakness and faults. The education of the conscience 
guarantees freedom and engenders peace of heart. (1742) 

1785 In the formation of conscience the Word of God is the light for our path;^4 W e must assimilate 
it in faith and prayer and put it into practice. We must also examine our conscience before the 
Lord’s Cross. We are assisted by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, aided by the witness or advice of 
others and guided by the authoritative teaching of the Church.^ (890) 

III. To Choose in Accord with Conscience 

1786 Faced with a moral choice, conscience can make either a right judgment in accordance with 
reason and the divine law or, on the contrary, an erroneous judgment that departs from them. 

1787 Man is sometimes confronted by situations that make moral judgments less assured and 
decision difficult. But he must always seriously seek what is right and good and discern the will of 
God expressed in divine law. (1955) 

1788 To this purpose, man strives to interpret the data of experience and the signs of the times 
assisted by the virtue of prudence, by the advice of competent people, and by the help of the Holy 
Spirit and his gifts. ( 1806 ) 

1789 Some rules apply in every case: ( 1756 . 1970 . 1827 . 1971 ) 

—One may never do evil so that good may result from it; 

—the Golden Rule: “Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.”^ 

—charity always proceeds by way of respect for one’s neighbor and his conscience: “Thus 
sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience... you sin against Christ.”^ 
Therefore “it is right not to... do anything that makes your brother stumble.”^ 











IV. Erroneous Judgment 


1790 A human being must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience. If he were 
deliberately to act against it, he would condemn himself. Yet it can happen that moral conscience 
remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already 
committed. 

1791 This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility. This is the case when a man 
“takes little trouble to find out what is true and good, or when conscience is by degrees almost 
blinded through the habit of committing sin.”^2 In such cases, the person is culpable for the evil he 
commits. ( 1704 ) 

1792 Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example given by others, enslavement to one’s 
passions, assertion of a mistaken notion of autonomy of conscience, rejection of the Church’s 
authority and her teaching, lack of conversion and of charity: these can be at the source of errors of 
judgment in moral conduct. (133) 

1793 If—on the contrary—the ignorance is invincible, or the moral subject is not responsible for 
his erroneous judgment, the evil committed by the person cannot be imputed to him. It remains no 
less an evil, a privation, a disorder. One must therefore work to correct the errors of moral 
conscience. ( 1860 ) 

1794 A good and pure conscience is enlightened by true faith, for charity proceeds at the same time 
“from a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith.”^ ( 1751 ) 

The more a correct conscience prevails, the more do persons and groups turn aside from blind 
choice and try to be guided by objective standards of moral conduct.^ 


IN BRIEF 

1795 “Conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose 
voice echoes in his depths” (GS 16). 


1796 Conscience is a judgment of reason by which the human person recognizes the moral quality 
of a concrete act. 








1797 For the man who has committed evil, the verdict of his conscience remains a pledge of 
conversion and of hope. 

1798 A well-formed conscience is upright and truthful. It formulates its judgments according to 
reason, in conformity with the true good willed by the wisdom of the Creator. Everyone must avail 
himself of the means to form his conscience. 

1799 Faced with a moral choice, conscience can make either a right judgment in accordance with 
reason and the divine law or, on the contrary, an erroneous judgment that departs from them. 

1800 A human being must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience. 

1801 Conscience can remain in ignorance or make erroneous judgments. Such ignorance and errors 
are not always free of guilt. 

1802 The Word of God is a light for our path. We must assimilate it in faith and prayer and put it 
into practice. This is how moral conscience is formed. 


ARTICLE 7 

THE VIRTUES 


1803 “Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is 
lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think 
about these things.”^ ( 1733 , 1768 1 

A virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good. It allows the person not only to 
perform good acts, but to give the best of himself. The virtuous person tends toward the good with 
all his sensory and spiritual powers; he pursues the good and chooses it in concrete actions. 

The goal of a virtuous life is to become like God.^3 

I. The Human Virtues 

1804 Human virtues are firm attitudes, stable dispositions, habitual perfections of intellect and will 
that govern our actions, order our passions, and guide our conduct according to reason and faith. 
They make possible ease, self-mastery, and joy in leading a morally good life. The virtuous man is 
he who freely practices the good. ( 2500 . 1827 ) 

The moral virtues are acquired by human effort. They are the fruit and seed of morally good 











acts; they dispose all the powers of the human being for communion with divine love. 

The cardinal virtues 

1805 Four virtues play a pivotal role and accordingly are called “cardinal”; all the others are 
grouped around them. They are: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. “If anyone loves 
righteousness, [Wisdom’s] labors are virtues; for she teaches temperance and prudence, justice, and 
courage.”^ These virtues are praised under other names in many passages of Scripture. 

1806 Prudence is the virtue that disposes practical reason to discern our true good in every 
circumstance and to choose the right means of achieving it; “the prudent man looks where he is 
going.”h5 “Keep sane and sober for your prayers.Prudence is “right reason in action,” writes St. 
Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle.^ It is not to be confused with timidity or fear, nor with 
duplicity or dissimulation. It is called auriga virtutum (the charioteer of the virtues); it guides the 
other virtues by setting rule and measure. It is prudence that immediately guides the judgment of 
conscience. The prudent man determines and directs his conduct in accordance with this judgment. 
With the help of this virtue we apply moral principles to particular cases without error and 
overcome doubts about the good to achieve and the evil to avoid. (1788, 1780 1 

1807 Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm will to give their due to God 
and neighbor. Justice toward God is called the “virtue of religion.” Justice toward men disposes one 
to respect the rights of each and to establish in human relationships the harmony that promotes 
equity with regard to persons and to the common good. The just man, often mentioned in the 
Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct 
toward his neighbor. “You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness 
shall you judge your neighbor.”^ “Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you 
also have a Master in heaven. ”§2 ( 2095 . 2401 1 

1808 Fortitude is the moral virtue that ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit 
of the good. It strengthens the resolve to resist temptations and to overcome obstacles in the moral 
life. The virtue of fortitude enables one to conquer fear, even fear of death, and to face trials and 
persecutions. It disposes one even to renounce and sacrifice his life in defense of a just cause. “The 
Lord is my strength and my song.”2Q “In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I 
have overcome the world.”2d ( 2848 . 2473 1 

1809 Temperance is the moral virtue that moderates the attraction of pleasures and provides 
balance in the use of created goods. It ensures the will’s mastery over instincts and keeps desires 








within the limits of what is honorable. The temperate person directs the sensitive appetites toward 
what is good and maintains a healthy discretion: “Do not follow your inclination and strength, 
walking according to the desires of your heart.” ^ Temperance is often praised in the Old 
Testament: “Do not follow your base desires, but restrain your appetites. ”23 i n the New Testament 
it is called “moderation” or “sobriety.” We ought “to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this 
world. ”24 1 2341 . 2517 1 

To live well is nothing other than to love God with all one’s heart, with all one’s soul and with 
all one’s efforts; from this it comes about that love is kept whole and uncorrupted (through 
temperance). No misfortune can disturb it (and this is fortitude). It obeys only [God] (and this 
is justice), and is careful in discerning things, so as not to be surprised by deceit or trickery 
(and this is prudence). 25 

The virtues and grace 

1810 Human virtues acquired by education, by deliberate acts and by a perseverance ever-renewed 
in repeated efforts are purified and elevated by divine grace. With God’s help, they forge character 
and give facility in the practice of the good. The virtuous man is happy to practice them. ( 1266 1 

1811 It is not easy for man, wounded by sin, to maintain moral balance. Christ’s gift of salvation 
offers us the grace necessary to persevere in the pursuit of the virtues. Everyone should always ask 
for this grace of light and strength, frequent the sacraments, cooperate with the Holy Spirit, and 
follow his calls to love what is good and shun evil. ( 2015 1 

II. The Theological Virtues 2086-2094 . 2656-2658 

1812 The human virtues are rooted in the theological virtues, which adapt man’s faculties for 
participation in the divine nature;25 for the theological virtues relate directly to God. They dispose 
Christians to live in a relationship with the Holy Trinity. They have the One and Triune God for 
their origin, motive, and object. ( 1266 1 

1813 The theological virtues are the foundation of Christian moral activity; they animate it and give 
it its special character. They inform and give life to all the moral virtues. They are infused by God 
into the souls of the faithful to make them capable of acting as his children and of meriting eternal 
life. They are the pledge of the presence and action of the Holy Spirit in the faculties of the human 
being. There are three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity. 2Z ( 2008 1 










Faith 142-175 


1814 Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and believe all that he has said and 
revealed to us, and that Holy Church proposes for our belief, because he is truth itself. By faith 
“man freely commits his entire self to God.”42 For this reason the believer seeks to know and do 
God’s will. “The righteous shall live by faith.” Living faith “work[s] through charity. ”22 (506) 

1815 The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it. 22 But “faith apart from works is 
dead”;2I when it is deprived of hope and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and 
does not make him a living member of his Body. 

1816 The disciple of Christ must not only keep the faith and live on it, but also profess it, 
confidently bear witness to it, and spread it: “All however must be prepared to confess Christ 
before men and to follow him along the way of the Cross, amidst the persecutions which the 
Church never lacks. ”22 Service of and witness to the faith are necessary for salvation: “So every 
one who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; 
but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.”22 (2471) 

Hope 

1817 Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as 
our happiness, placing our trust in Christ’s promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the 
help of the grace of the Holy Spirit. “Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, 
for he who promised is faithful. ”24 “The Holy Spirit... he poured out upon us richly through Jesus 
Christ our Savior, so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal 
life. ”22 (1024) 

1818 The virtue of hope responds to the aspiration to happiness which God has placed in the heart 
of every man; it takes up the hopes that inspire men’s activities and purifies them so as to order 
them to the Kingdom of heaven; it keeps man from discouragement; it sustains him during times of 
abandonment; it opens up his heart in expectation of eternal beatitude. Buoyed up by hope, he is 
preserved from selfishness and led to the happiness that flows from charity. (27) 

1819 Christian hope takes up and fulfills the hope of the chosen people which has its origin and 
model in the hope of Abraham, who was blessed abundantly by the promises of God fulfilled in 
Isaac, and who was purified by the test of the sacrifice.22 “Hoping against hope, he believed, and 
thus became the father of many nations. ”27 (146) 







1820 Christian hope unfolds from the beginning of Jesus’ preaching in the proclamation of the 
beatitudes. The beatitudes raise our hope toward heaven as the new Promised Land; they trace the 
path that leads through the trials that await the disciples of Jesus. But through the merits of Jesus 
Christ and of his Passion, God keeps us in the “hope that does not disappoint.”^ Hope is the “sure 
and steadfast anchor of the soul... that enters... where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our 
behalf.”^ Hope is also a weapon that protects us in the struggle of salvation: “Let us... put on the 
breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. it affords us joy even 
under trial: “Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation.”^ Hope is expressed and nourished in 
prayer, especially in the Our Father, the summary of everything that hope leads us to desire. ( 1716 . 
2772 1 

1821 We can therefore hope in the glory of heaven promised by God to those who love him and do 
his will.22 In every circumstance, each one of us should hope, with the grace of God, to persevere 
“to the end”23 and to obtain the joy of heaven, as God’s eternal reward for the good works 
accomplished with the grace of Christ. In hope, the Church prays for “all men to be saved.”24 She 
longs to be united with Christ, her Bridegroom, in the glory of heaven: ( 2016 . 1037 ) 

Hope, O my soul, hope. You know neither the day nor the hour. Watch carefully, for 
everything passes quickly, even though your impatience makes doubtful what is certain, and 
turns a very short time into a long one. Dream that the more you struggle, the more you prove 
the love that you bear your God, and the more you will rejoice one day with your Beloved, in 
a happiness and rapture that can never end.— 

Charity 

1822 Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and 
our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God. ( 1723 ) 

1823 Jesus makes charity the new commandment By loving his own “to the end,”^7 he makes 
manifest the Father’s love which he receives. By loving one another, the disciples imitate the love 
of Jesus which they themselves receive. Whence Jesus says: “As the Father has loved me, so have I 
loved you; abide in my love.” And again: “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I 
have loved you.”2£ (1970) 

1824 Fruit of the Spirit and fullness of the Law, charity keeps the commandments of God and his 
Christ: “Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love. ”2^ (735) 









1825 Christ died out of love for us, while we were still “enemies.”!^ The Lord asks us to love as 
he does, even our enemies, to make ourselves the neighbor of those farthest away, and to love 
children and the poor as Christ himself.1^1 (604) 

The Apostle Paul has given an incomparable depiction of charity: “charity is patient and kind, 
charity is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Charity does not insist on its own 
way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. 
Charity bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”1^2 

1826 “If I... have not charity,” says the Apostle, “I am nothing.” Whatever my privilege, service, or 
even virtue, “if I... have not charity, I gain nothing.”!^ Charity is superior to all the virtues. It is 
the first of the theological virtues: “So faith, hope, charity abide, these three. But the greatest of 
these is charity.”^ 

1827 The practice of all the virtues is animated and inspired by charity, which “binds everything 
together in perfect harmony”;^ it is the form of the virtues; it articulates and orders them among 
themselves; it is the source and the goal of their Christian practice. Charity upholds and purifies our 
human ability to love, and raises it to the supernatural perfection of divine love. (815, 826 1 

1828 The practice of the moral life animated by charity gives to the Christian the spiritual freedom 
of the children of God. He no longer stands before God as a slave, in servile fear, or as a mercenary 
looking for wages, but as a son responding to the love of him who “first loved us”:^ (1972) 

If we turn away from evil out of fear of punishment, we are in the position of slaves. If we 
pursue the enticement of wages,... we resemble mercenaries. Finally if we obey for the sake of 
the good itself and out of love for him who commands... we are in the position of children.!^ 

1829 The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy; charity demands beneficence and fraternal 
correction; it is benevolence; it fosters reciprocity and remains disinterested and generous; it is 
friendship and communion: ( 2540 ) 

Love is itself the fulfillment of all our works. There is the goal; that is why we run: we run 
toward it, and once we reach it, in it we shall find rest.l^ 

III. The Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit 


1830 The moral life of Christians is sustained by the gifts of the Holy Spirit. These are permanent 







dispositions which make man docile in following the promptings of the Holy Spirit. 

1831 The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, 
piety, and fear of the Lord. They belong in their fullness to Christ, Son of David.109 They complete 
and perfect the virtues of those who receive them. They make the faithful docile in readily obeying 
divine inspirations. ( 1266 . 1299 1 

Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.HU 

For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God... If children, then heirs, heirs of God 
and fellow heirs with Christ.— 

1832 The fruits of the Spirit are perfections that the Holy Spirit forms in us as the first fruits of 
eternal glory. The tradition of the Church lists twelve of them: “charity, joy, peace, patience, 
kindness, goodness, generosity, gentleness, faithfulness, modesty, self-control, chastity.”H2 ( 736 ) 


IN BRIEF 

1833 Virtue is a habitual and firm disposition to do good. 

1834 The human virtues are stable dispositions of the intellect and the will that govern our acts, 
order our passions, and guide our conduct in accordance with reason and faith. They can be 
grouped around the four cardinal virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. 

1835 Prudence disposes the practical reason to discern, in every circumstance, our true good and to 
choose the right means for achieving it. 

1836 Justice consists in the firm and constant will to give God and neighbor their due. 

1837 Fortitude ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of the good. 

1838 Temperance moderates the attraction of the pleasures of the senses and provides balance in 
the use of created goods. 

1839 The moral virtues grow through education, deliberate acts, and perseverance in struggle. 
Divine grace purifies and elevates them. 







1840 The theological virtues dispose Christians to live in a relationship with the Holy Trinity. They 
have God for their origin, their motive, and their object—God known by faith, God hoped in and 
loved for his own sake. 

1841 There are three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity. They inform all the moral virtues 
and give life to them. 

1842 By faith, we believe in God and believe all that he has revealed to us and that Holy Church 
proposes for our belief. 

1843 By hope we desire, and with steadfast trust await from God, eternal life and the graces to 
merit it. 

1844 By charity, we love God above all things and our neighbor as ourselves for love of God. 
Charity, the form of all the virtues, “binds everything together in perfect harmony” (Co/ 3:14). 

1845 The seven gifts of the Holy Spirit bestowed upon Christians are wisdom, understanding, 
counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. 


ARTICLE 8 

SIN 


I. Mercy and Sin 

1846 The Gospel is the revelation in Jesus Christ of God’s mercy to sinners.H4 The angel 
announced to Joseph: “You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their 
sins.The same is true of the Eucharist, the sacrament of redemption: “This is my blood of the 
covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”H^ ( 430 . 1365 1 

1847 “God created us without us: but he did not will to save us without us.”H§ To receive his 
mercy, we must admit our faults. “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is 
not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive our sins and cleanse us 
from all unrighteousness. ”1H ( 387 . 1455 1 


1848 As St. Paul affirms, “Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.”H4 But to do its 
work grace must uncover sin so as to convert our hearts and bestow on us “righteousness to eternal 











life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”l^ Like a physician who probes the wound before treating it, 
God, by his Word and by his Spirit, casts a living light on sin: (385, 1433 ) 

Conversion requires convincing of sin; it includes the interior judgment of conscience, and 
this, being a proof of the action of the Spirit of truth in man’s inmost being, becomes at the 
same time the start of a new grant of grace and love: “Receive the Holy Spirit.” Thus in this 
“convincing concerning sin” we discover a double gift: the gift of the truth of conscience and 
the gift of the certainty of redemption. The Spirit of truth is the Consoler.^ 

II. The Definition of Sin 

1849 Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for 
God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods. It wounds the nature of man 
and injures human solidarity. It has been defined as “an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the 
eternal law.”i^ (3U, 1952 1 

1850 Sin is an offense against God: “Against you, you alone, have I sinned, and done that which is 
evil in your sight.”123 sin sets itself against God’s love for us and turns our hearts away from it. 
Like the first sin, it is disobedience, a revolt against God through the will to become “like gods,”l^ 
knowing and determining good and evil. Sin is thus “love of oneself even to contempt of God.”l^ 
In this proud self-exaltation, sin is diametrically opposed to the obedience of Jesus, which achieves 
our salvation.!^ (' 1440 . 397 . 615 1 

1851 It is precisely in the Passion, when the mercy of Christ is about to vanquish it, that sin most 
clearly manifests its violence and its many forms: unbelief, murderous hatred, shunning and 
mockery by the leaders and the people, Pilate’s cowardice and the cruelty of the soldiers, Judas’ 
betrayal—so bitter to Jesus, Peter’s denial and the disciples’ flight. However, at the very hour of 
darkness, the hour of the prince of this world,the sacrifice of Christ secretly becomes the source 
from which the forgiveness of our sins will pour forth inexhaustibly. (598, 2746 . 616 ) 

III. The Different Kinds of Sins 

1852 There are a great many kinds of sins. Scripture provides several lists of them. The Letter to 
the Galatians contrasts the works of the flesh with the fruit of the Spirit: “Now the works of the 
flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, 
anger, selfishness, dissension, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I 
warned you before, that those who do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.”l^ 












1853 Sins can be distinguished according to their objects, as can every human act; or according to 
the virtues they oppose, by excess or defect; or according to the commandments they violate. They 
can also be classed according to whether they concern God, neighbor, or oneself; they can be 
divided into spiritual and carnal sins, or again as sins in thought, word, deed, or omission. The root 
of sin is in the heart of man, in his free will, according to the teaching of the Lord: “For out of the 
heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These are what 
defile a man.”T^ But in the heart also resides charity, the source of the good and pure works, which 
sin wounds. ( 1751 . 2067 . 368) 

IV. The Gravity of Sin: Mortal and Venial Sin 

1854 Sins are rightly evaluated according to their gravity. The distinction between mortal and 
venial sin, already evident in Scripture,^ became part of the tradition of the Church. It is 
corroborated by human experience. 

1855 Mortal sin destroys charity in the heart of man by a grave violation of God’s law; it turns man 
away from God, who is his ultimate end and his beatitude, by preferring an inferior good to him. 
(1395) 

Venial sin allows charity to subsist, even though it offends and wounds it. 

1856 Mortal sin, by attacking the vital principle within us—that is, charity—necessitates a new 
initiative of God’s mercy and a conversion of heart which is normally accomplished within the 
setting of the sacrament of reconciliation: (1446) 

When the will sets itself upon something that is of its nature incompatible with the charity that 
orients man toward his ultimate end, then the sin is mortal by its very object... whether it 
contradicts the love of God, such as blasphemy or perjury, or the love of neighbor, such as 
homicide or adultery.... But when the sinner’s will is set upon something that of its nature 
involves a disorder, but is not opposed to the love of God and neighbor, such as thoughtless 
chatter or immoderate laughter and the like, such sins are venial. TJQ 

1857 For a sin to be mortal, three conditions must together be met: “Mortal sin is sin whose object 
is grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent.”TTL 

1858 Grave matter is specified by the Ten Commandments, corresponding to the answer of Jesus to 
the rich young man: “Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, 
Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother.”^ The gravity of sins is more or less great: 







murder is graver than theft. One must also take into account who is wronged: violence against 
parents is in itself graver than violence against a stranger. (2072, 2214 1 

1859 Mortal sin requires full knowledge and complete consent. It presupposes knowledge of the 
sinful character of the act, of its opposition to God’s law. It also implies a consent sufficiently 
deliberate to be a personal choice. Feigned ignorance and hardness of hearth do not diminish, but 
rather increase, the voluntary character of a sin. (1734) 

1860 Unintentional ignorance can diminish or even remove the imputability of a grave offense. But 
no one is deemed to be ignorant of the principles of the moral law, which are written in the 
conscience of every man. The promptings of feelings and passions can also diminish the voluntary 
and free character of the offense, as can external pressures or pathological disorders. Sin committed 
through malice, by deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest. ( 1735 . 1767 ) 

1861 Mortal sin is a radical possibility of human freedom, as is love itself. It results in the loss of 
charity and the privation of sanctifying grace, that is, of the state of grace. If it is not redeemed by 
repentance and God’s forgiveness, it causes exclusion from Christ’s kingdom and the eternal death 
of hell, for our freedom has the power to make choices for ever, with no turning back. However, 
although we can judge that an act is in itself a grave offense, we must entrust judgment of persons 
to the justice and mercy of God. ( 1742 . 1033 1 

1862 One commits venial sin when, in a less serious matter, he does not observe the standard 
prescribed by the moral law, or when he disobeys the moral law in a grave matter, but without full 
knowledge or without complete consent. 

1863 Venial sin weakens charity; it manifests a disordered affection for created goods; it impedes 
the soul’s progress in the exercise of the virtues and the practice of the moral good; it merits 
temporal punishment. Deliberate and unrepented venial sin disposes us little by little to commit 
mortal sin. However venial sin does not break the covenant with God. With God’s grace it is 
humanly reparable. “Venial sin does not deprive the sinner of sanctifying grace, friendship with 
God, charity, and consequently eternal happiness.”!^ ( 1394 . 1472 1 

While he is in the flesh, man cannot help but have at least some light sins. But do not despise 
these sins which we call “light”: if you take them for light when you weigh them, tremble 
when you count them. A number of light objects makes a great mass; a number of drops fills a 
river; a number of grains makes a heap. What then is our hope? Above all, confession.... 











1864 “Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy 
against the Spirit will not be forgiven.”^ There are no limits to the mercy of God, but anyone who 
deliberately refuses to accept his mercy by repenting, rejects the forgiveness of his sins and the 
salvation offered by the Holy Spirit.142 Such hardness of heart can lead to final impenitence and 
eternal loss. ( 2091 . 1037 1 

V. The Proliferation of Sin 

1865 Sin creates a proclivity to sin; it engenders vice by repetition of the same acts. This results in 
perverse inclinations which cloud conscience and corrupt the concrete judgment of good and evil. 
Thus sin tends to reproduce itself and reinforce itself, but it cannot destroy the moral sense at its 
root. (401, 1768 1 

1866 Vices can be classified according to the virtues they oppose, or also be linked to the capital 
sins which Christian experience has distinguished, following St. John Cassian and St. Gregory the 
Great. They are called “capital” because they engender other sins, other vices. 122 They are pride, 
avarice, envy, wrath, lust, gluttony, and sloth or acedia. ( 2539 1 

1867 The catechetical tradition also recalls that there are “sins that cry to heaven the blood of 
Abel, 142 the sin of the Sodomites, 142 the cry of the people oppressed in Egypt, 141 the cry of the 
foreigner, the widow, and the orphan, 142 injustice to the wage earner. 142 ( 2268 1 

1868 Sin is a personal act. Moreover, we have a responsibility for the sins committed by others 
when we cooperate in them: ( 1736 1 

—by participating directly and voluntarily in them; 

—by ordering, advising, praising, or approving them; 

—by not disclosing or not hindering them when we have an obligation to do so; 

—by protecting evil-doers. 

1869 Thus sin makes men accomplices of one another and causes concupiscence, violence, and 
injustice to reign among them. Sins give rise to social situations and institutions that are contrary to 
the divine goodness. “Structures of sin” are the expression and effect of personal sins. They lead 
their victims to do evil in their turn. In an analogous sense, they constitute a “social sin.”144 ( 408 . 
1887 1 













IN BRIEF 


1870 “God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all” (Rom 11:32). 

1871 Sin is an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law (St. Augustine, Faust 22: PL 
42, 418). It is an offense against God. It rises up against God in a disobedience contrary to the 
obedience of Christ. 

1872 Sin is an act contrary to reason. It wounds man’s nature and injures human solidarity. 

1873 The root of all sins lies in man’s heart. The kinds and the gravity of sins are determined 
principally by their objects. 

1874 To choose deliberately—that is, both knowing it and willing it—something gravely contrary 
to the divine law and to the ultimate end of man is to commit a mortal sin. This destroys in us the 
charity without which eternal beatitude is impossible. Unrepented, it brings eternal death. 

1875 Venial sin constitutes a moral disorder that is reparable by charity, which it allows to subsist 
in us. 

1876 The repetition of sins—even venial ones—engenders vices, among which are the capital sins.

CHAPTER TWO 
THE HUMAN COMMUNITY 


1877 The vocation of humanity is to show forth the image of God and to be transformed into the 
image of the Father’s only Son. This vocation takes a personal form since each of us is called to 
enter into the divine beatitude; it also concerns the human community as a whole. 

ARTICLE 1 

THE PERSON AND SOCIETY 


I. The Communal Character of the Human Vocation 

1878 All men are called to the same end: God himself. There is a certain resemblance between the 
unity of the divine persons and the fraternity that men are to establish among themselves in truth 
and love.i Love of neighbor is inseparable from love for God. 

1879 The human person needs to live in society. Society is not for him an extraneous addition but a 
requirement of his nature. Through the exchange with others, mutual service and dialogue with his 
brethren, man develops his potential; he thus responds to his vocation.^ 

1880 A society is a group of persons bound together organically by a principle of unity that goes 
beyond each one of them. As an assembly that is at once visible and spiritual, a society endures 
through time: it gathers up the past and prepares for the future. By means of society, each man is 
established as an “heir” and receives certain “talents” that enrich his identity and whose fruits he 
must develop.3 He rightly owes loyalty to the communities of which he is part and respect to those 
in authority who have charge of the common good. 

1881 Each community is defined by its purpose and consequently obeys specific rules; but “the 
human person... is and ought to be the principle, the subject and the end of all social institutions.”^ 

1882 Certain societies, such as the family and the state, correspond more directly to the nature of 
man; they are necessary to him. To promote the participation of the greatest number in the life of a 
society, the creation of voluntary associations and institutions must be encouraged “on both 
national and international levels, which relate to economic and social goals, to cultural and 
recreational activities, to sport, to various professions, and to political affairs.”^ This 
“socialization” also expresses the natural tendency for human beings to associate with one another 




for the sake of attaining objectives that exceed individual capacities. It develops the qualities of the 
person, especially the sense of initiative and responsibility, and helps guarantee his rights.^ 

1883 Socialization also presents dangers. Excessive intervention by the state can threaten personal 
freedom and initiative. The teaching of the Church has elaborated the principle of subsidiarity, 
according to which “a community of a higher order should not interfere in the internal life of a 
community of a lower order, depriving the latter of its functions, but rather should support it in case 
of need and help to co-ordinate its activity with the activities of the rest of society, always with a 
view to the common good.”^ 

1884 God has not willed to reserve to himself all exercise of power. He entrusts to every creature 
the functions it is capable of performing, according to the capacities of its own nature. This mode 
of governance ought to be followed in social life. The way God acts in governing the world, which 
bears witness to such great regard for human freedom, should inspire the wisdom of those who 
govern human communities. They should behave as ministers of divine providence. 

1885 The principle of subsidiarity is opposed to all forms of collectivism. It sets limits for state 
intervention. It aims at harmonizing the relationships between individuals and societies. It tends 
toward the establishment of true international order. 

II. Conversion and Society 

1886 Society is essential to the fulfillment of the human vocation. To attain this aim, respect must 
be accorded to the just hierarchy of values, which “subordinates physical and instinctual 
dimensions to interior and spiritual ones:”- 

Human society must primarily be considered something pertaining to the spiritual. Through it, 
in the bright light of truth, men should share their knowledge, be able to exercise their rights 
and fulfill their obligations, be inspired to seek spiritual values; mutually derive genuine 
pleasure from the beautiful, of whatever order it be; always be readily disposed to pass on to 
others the best of their own cultural heritage; and eagerly strive to make their own the spiritual 
achievements of others. These benefits not only influence, but at the same time give aim and 
scope to all that has bearing on cultural expressions, economic, and social institutions, political 
movements and forms, laws, and all other structures by which society is outwardly established 
and constantly developed.^ 

1887 The inversion of means and ends,l^ which results in giving the value of ultimate end to what 


is only a means for attaining it, or in viewing persons as mere means to that end, engenders unjust 
structures which “make Christian conduct in keeping with the commandments of the divine Law¬ 
giver difficult and almost impossible.”^ 

1888 It is necessary, then, to appeal to the spiritual and moral capacities of the human person and to 
the permanent need for his inner conversion, so as to obtain social changes that will really serve 
him. The acknowledged priority of the conversion of heart in no way eliminates but on the contrary 
imposes the obligation of bringing the appropriate remedies to institutions and living conditions 
when they are an inducement to sin, so that they conform to the norms of justice and advance the 
good rather than hinder it.l^ 

1889 Without the help of grace, men would not know how “to discern the often narrow path 
between the cowardice which gives in to evil, and the violence which under the illusion of fighting 
evil only makes it worse.This is the path of charity, that is, of the love of God and of neighbor. 
Charity is the greatest social commandment. It respects others and their rights. It requires the 
practice of justice, and it alone makes us capable of it. Charity inspires a life of self-giving: 
“Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.”14 


IN BRIEF 

1890 There is a certain resemblance between the unity of the divine persons and the fraternity that 
men ought to establish among themselves. 

1891 The human person needs life in society in order to develop in accordance with his nature. 
Certain societies, such as the family and the state, correspond more directly to the nature of man. 

1892 “The human person... is and ought to be the principle, the subject, and the object of every 
social organization” (GS 25 § 1). 

1893 Widespread participation in voluntary associations and institutions is to be encouraged. 

1894 In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, neither the state nor any larger society should 
substitute itself for the initiative and responsibility of individuals and intermediary bodies. 

1895 Society ought to promote the exercise of virtue, not obstruct it. It should be animated by a just 
hierarchy of values. 




1896 Where sin has perverted the social climate, it is necessary to call for the conversion of hearts 
and appeal to the grace of God. Charity urges just reforms. There is no solution to the social 
question apart from the Gospel (cf. CA 3, 5). 


ARTICLE 2 

PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL LIFE 


I. Authority 

1897 “Human society can be neither well-ordered nor prosperous unless it has some people 
invested with legitimate authority to preserve its institutions and to devote themselves as far as is 
necessary to work and care for the good of all.”15 

By “authority” one means the quality by virtue of which persons or institutions make laws and give 
orders to men and expect obedience from them. 

1898 Every human community needs an authority to govern it.— The foundation of such authority 
lies in human nature. It is necessary for the unity of the state. Its role is to ensure as far as possible 
the common good of the society. 

1899 The authority required by the moral order derives from God: “Let every person be subject to 
the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been 
instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and 
those who resist will incur judgment.”!^ 

1900 The duty of obedience requires all to give due honor to authority and to treat those who are 
charged to exercise it with respect, and, insofar as it is deserved, with gratitude and good-will. 

Pope St. Clement of Rome provides the Church’s most ancient prayer for political 
authorities: IS “Grant to them, Lord, health, peace, concord, and stability, so that they may 
exercise without offense the sovereignty that you have given them. Master, heavenly King of 
the ages, you give glory, honor, and power over the things of earth to the sons of men. Direct, 
Lord, their counsel, following what is pleasing and acceptable in your sight, so that by 
exercising with devotion and in peace and gentleness the power that you have given to them, 
they may find favor with you.”lS 

1901 If authority belongs to the order established by God, “the choice of the political regime and 








the appointment of rulers are left to the free decision of the citizens. ”22 

The diversity of political regimes is morally acceptable, provided they serve the legitimate 
good of the communities that adopt them. Regimes whose nature is contrary to the natural law, to 
the public order, and to the fundamental rights of persons cannot achieve the common good of the 
nations on which they have been imposed. 

1902 Authority does not derive its moral legitimacy from itself. It must not behave in a despotic 
manner, but must act for the common good as a “moral force based on freedom and a sense of 
responsibility”:^ 

A human law has the character of law to the extent that it accords with right reason, and thus 
derives from the eternal law. Insofar as it falls short of right reason it is said to be an unjust 
law, and thus has not so much the nature of law as of a kind of violence. 

1903 Authority is exercised legitimately only when it seeks the common good of the group 
concerned and if it employs morally licit means to attain it. If rulers were to enact unjust laws or 
take measures contrary to the moral order, such arrangements would not be binding in conscience. 
In such a case, “authority breaks down completely and results in shameful abuse. ”22 

1904 “It is preferable that each power be balanced by other powers and by other spheres of 
responsibility which keep it within proper bounds. This is the principle of the ‘rule of law,’ in 
which the law is sovereign and not the arbitrary will of men.”24 

II. The Common Good 

1905 In keeping with the social nature of man, the good of each individual is necessarily related to 
the common good, which in turn can be defined only in reference to the human person: 

Do not live entirely isolated, having retreated into yourselves, as if you were already justified, 
but gather instead to seek the common good together.25 

1906 By common good is to be understood “the sum total of social conditions which allow people, 
either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily.”22 The 
common good concerns the life of all. It calls for prudence from each, and even more from those 
who exercise the office of authority. It consists of three essential elements: 


1907 First, the common good presupposes respect for the person as such. In the name of the 


common good, public authorities are bound to respect the fundamental and inalienable rights of the 
human person. Society should permit each of its members to fulfill his vocation. In particular, the 
common good resides in the conditions for the exercise of the natural freedoms indispensable for 
the development of the human vocation, such as “the right to act according to a sound norm of 
conscience and to safeguard... privacy, and rightful freedom also in matters of religion.’’^! 

1908 Second, the common good requires the social well-being and development of the group itself. 
Development is the epitome of all social duties. Certainly, it is the proper function of authority to 
arbitrate, in the name of the common good, between various particular interests; but it should make 
accessible to each what is needed to lead a truly human life: food, clothing, health, work, education 
and culture, suitable information, the right to establish a family, and so on.^ 

1909 Finally, the common good requires peace, that is, the stability and security of a just order. It 
presupposes that authority should ensure by morally acceptable means the security of society and 
its members. It is the basis of the right to legitimate personal and collective defence. 

1910 Each human community possesses a common good which permits it to be recognized as such; 
it is in the political community that its most complete realization is found. It is the role of the state 
to defend and promote the common good of civil society, its citizens, and intermediate bodies. 

1911 Human interdependence is increasing and gradually spreading throughout the world. The 
unity of the human family, embracing people who enjoy equal natural dignity, implies a universal 
common good. This good calls for an organization of the community of nations able to “provide for 
the different needs of men; this will involve the sphere of social life to which belong questions of 
food, hygiene, education,... and certain situations arising here and there, as for example... 
alleviating the miseries of refugees dispersed throughout the world, and assisting migrants and their 
families.”^ 


1912 The common good is always oriented towards the progress of persons: “The order of things 
must be subordinate to the order of persons, and not the other way around.”^ This order is founded 
on truth, built up in justice, and animated by love. 

III. Responsibility and Participation 

1913 “Participation” is the voluntary and generous engagement of a person in social interchange. It 
is necessary that all participate, each according to his position and role, in promoting the common 
good. This obligation is inherent in the dignity of the human person. 


1914 Participation is achieved first of all by taking charge of the areas for which one assumes 
personal responsibility: by the care taken for the education of his family, by conscientious work, 
and so forth, man participates in the good of others and of society.^ 

1915 As far as possible citizens should take an active part in public life. The manner of this 
participation may vary from one country or culture to another. “One must pay tribute to those 
nations whose systems permit the largest possible number of the citizens to take part in public life 
in a climate of genuine freedom.”^ 

1916 As with any ethical obligation, the participation of all in realizing the common good calls for 
a continually renewed conversion of the social partners. Fraud and other subterfuges, by which 
some people evade the constraints of the law and the prescriptions of societal obligation, must be 
firmly condemned because they are incompatible with the requirements of justice. Much care 
should be taken to promote institutions that improve the conditions of human life. 

1917 It is incumbent on those who exercise authority to strengthen the values that inspire the 
confidence of the members of the group and encourage them to put themselves at the service of 
others. Participation begins with education and culture. “One is entitled to think that the future of 
humanity is in the hands of those who are capable of providing the generations to come with 
reasons for life and optimism. ”24 


IN BRIEF 

1918 “There is no authority except from God, and those authorities that exist have been instituted 
by God” (Rom 13:1). 

1919 Every human community needs an authority in order to endure and develop. 

1920 “The political community and public authority are based on human nature and therefore... 
belong to an order established by God” (GS 74 § 3). 

1921 Authority is exercised legitimately if it is committed to the common good of society. To attain 
this it must employ morally acceptable means. 

1922 The diversity of political regimes is legitimate, provided they contribute to the good of the 
community. 




1923 Political authority must be exercised within the limits of the moral order and must guarantee 
the conditions for the exercise of freedom. 

1924 The common good comprises “the sum total of social conditions which allow people, either as 
groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily” (GS 26 § 1). 

1925 The common good consists of three essential elements: respect for and promotion of the 
fundamental rights of the person; prosperity, or the development of the spiritual and temporal 
goods of society; the peace and security of the group and of its members. 

1926 The dignity of the human person requires the pursuit of the common good. Everyone should 
be concerned to create and support institutions that improve the conditions of human life. 

1927 It is the role of the state to defend and promote the common good of civil society. The 
common good of the whole human family calls for an organization of society on the international 
level. 


ARTICLE 3 

SOCIAL JUSTICE 


1928 Society ensures social justice when it provides the conditions that allow associations or 
individuals to obtain what is their due, according to their nature and their vocation. Social justice is 
linked to the common good and the exercise of authority. 

I. Respect for the Human Person 

1929 Social justice can be obtained only in respecting the transcendent dignity of man. The person 
represents the ultimate end of society, which is ordered to him: 

What is at stake is the dignity of the human person, whose defense and promotion have been 
entrusted to us by the Creator, and to whom the men and women at every moment of history 
are strictly and responsibly in debt.— 

1930 Respect for the human person entails respect for the rights that flow from his dignity as a 
creature. These rights are prior to society and must be recognized by it. They are the basis of the 
moral legitimacy of every authority: by flouting them, or refusing to recognize them in its positive 






legislation, a society undermines its own moral legitimacy.^ If it does not respect them, authority 
can rely only on force or violence to obtain obedience from its subjects. It is the Church’s role to 
remind men of good will of these rights and to distinguish them from unwarranted or false claims. 

1931 Respect for the human person proceeds by way of respect for the principle that “everyone 
should look upon his neighbor (without any exception) as ‘another self,’ above all bearing in mind 
his life and the means necessary for living it with dignity.”^ No legislation could by itself do away 
with the fears, prejudices, and attitudes of pride and selfishness which obstruct the establishment of 
truly fraternal societies. Such behavior will cease only through the charity that finds in every man a 
“neighbor,” a brother. 

1932 The duty of making oneself a neighbor to others and actively serving them becomes even 
more urgent when it involves the disadvantaged, in whatever area this may be. “As you did it to one 
of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.”2£ 

1933 This same duty extends to those who think or act differently from us. The teaching of Christ 
goes so far as to require the forgiveness of offenses. He extends the commandment of love, which 
is that of the New Law, to all enemies.29 Liberation in the spirit of the Gospel is incompatible with 
hatred of one’s enemy as a person, but not with hatred of the evil that he does as an enemy. 

II. Equality and Differences Among Men 

1934 Created in the image of the one God and equally endowed with rational souls, all men have 
the same nature and the same origin. Redeemed by the sacrifice of Christ, all are called to 
participate in the same divine beatitude: all therefore enjoy an equal dignity. 

1935 The equality of men rests essentially on their dignity as persons and the rights that flow from 
it: 


Every form of social or cultural discrimination in fundamental personal rights on the grounds 
of sex, race, color, social conditions, language, or religion must be curbed and eradicated as 
incompatible with God’s design.^Q 

1936 On coming into the world, man is not equipped with everything he needs for developing his 
bodily and spiritual life. He needs others. Differences appear tied to age, physical abilities, 
intellectual or moral aptitudes, the benefits derived from social commerce, and the distribution of 
wealth.^! The “talents” are not distributed equally.42 


1937 These differences belong to God’s plan, who wills that each receive what he needs from 
others, and that those endowed with particular “talents” share the benefits with those who need 
them. These differences encourage and often oblige persons to practice generosity, kindness, and 
sharing of goods; they foster the mutual enrichment of cultures: 

I distribute the virtues quite diversely; I do not give all of them to each person, but some to 
one, some to others.... I shall give principally charity to one; justice to another; humility to this 
one, a living faith to that one.... And so I have given many gifts and graces, both spiritual and 
temporal, with such diversity that I have not given everything to one single person, so that you 
may be constrained to practice charity towards one another.... I have willed that one should 
need another and that all should be my ministers in distributing the graces and gifts they have 
received from me, 43 

1938 There exist also sinful inequalities that affect millions of men and women. These are in open 
contradiction of the Gospel: 

Their equal dignity as persons demands that we strive for fairer and more humane conditions. 
Excessive economic and social disparity between individuals and peoples of the one human 
race is a source of scandal and militates against social justice, equity, human dignity, as well 
as social and international peace. 44 

III. Human Solidarity 

1939 The principle of solidarity, also articulated in terms of “friendship” or “social charity,” is a 
direct demand of human and Christian brotherhood.^ 

An error, “today abundantly widespread, is disregard for the law of human solidarity and 
charity, dictated and imposed both by our common origin and by the equality in rational nature 
of all men, whatever nation they belong to. This law is sealed by the sacrifice of redemption 
offered by Jesus Christ on the altar of the Cross to his heavenly Father, on behalf of sinful 
humanity. ”4h 


1940 Solidarity is manifested in the first place by the distribution of goods and remuneration for 
work. It also presupposes the effort for a more just social order where tensions are better able to be 
reduced and conflicts more readily settled by negotiation. 


1941 Socio-economic problems can be resolved only with the help of all the forms of solidarity: 


solidarity of the poor among themselves, between rich and poor, of workers among themselves, 
between employers and employees in a business, solidarity among nations and peoples. 
International solidarity is a requirement of the moral order; world peace depends in part upon this. 

1942 The virtue of solidarity goes beyond material goods. In spreading the spiritual goods of the 
faith, the Church has promoted, and often opened new paths for, the development of temporal 
goods as well. And so throughout the centuries has the Lord’s saying been verified: “Seek first his 
kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well”:^ 

For two thousand years this sentiment has lived and endured in the soul of the Church, 
impelling souls then and now to the heroic charity of monastic farmers, liberators of slaves, 
healers of the sick, and messengers of faith, civilization, and science to all generations and all 
peoples for the sake of creating the social conditions capable of offering to everyone possible 
a life worthy of man and of a Christian.^ 


IN BRIEF 

1943 Society ensures social justice by providing the conditions that allow associations and 
individuals to obtain their due. 

1944 Respect for the human person considers the other “another self.” It presupposes respect for 
the fundamental rights that flow from the dignity intrinsic of the person. 

1945 The equality of men concerns their dignity as persons and the rights that flow from it. 

1946 The differences among persons belong to God’s plan, who wills that we should need one 
another. These differences should encourage charity. 

1947 The equal dignity of human persons requires the effort to reduce excessive social and 
economic inequalities. It gives urgency to the elimination of sinful inequalities. 

1948 Solidarity is an eminently Christian virtue. It practices the sharing of spiritual goods even 
more than material ones.

CHAPTER THREE 

GOD’S SALVATION: LAW AND GRACE 


1949 Called to beatitude but wounded by sin, man stands in need of salvation from God. Divine 
help comes to him in Christ through the law that guides him and the grace that sustains him: 

Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for God is at work in you, both to will 
and to work for his good pleasure X 

ARTICLE 1 

THE MORAL LAW 


1950 The moral law is the work of divine Wisdom. Its biblical meaning can be defined as fatherly 
instruction, God’s pedagogy. It prescribes for man the ways, the rules of conduct that lead to the 
promised beatitude; it proscribes the ways of evil which turn him away from God and his love. It is 
at once firm in its precepts and, in its promises, worthy of love. (53, 1719 ) 

1951 Law is a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the sake of the common good. 
The moral law presupposes the rational order, established among creatures for their good and to 
serve their final end, by the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Creator. All law finds its first and 
ultimate truth in the eternal law. Law is declared and established by reason as a participation in the 
providence of the living God, Creator and Redeemer of all. “Such an ordinance of reason is what 
one calls law. ”2 (295, 306, 301 1 

Alone among all animate beings, man can boast of having been counted worthy to receive a 
law from God: as an animal endowed with reason, capable of understanding and discernment, 
he is to govern his conduct by using his freedom and reason, in obedience to the One who has 
entrusted everything to him. 3 

1952 There are different expressions of the moral law, all of them interrelated: eternal law—the 
source, in God, of all law; natural law; revealed law, comprising the Old Law and the New Law, or 
Law of the Gospel; finally, civil and ecclesiastical laws. 

1953 The moral law finds its fullness and its unity in Christ. Jesus Christ is in person the way of 
perfection. He is the end of the law, for only he teaches and bestows the justice of God: “For Christ 








is the end of the law, that every one who has faith may be justified.”^ (578) 

I. The Natural Moral Law 

1954 Man participates in the wisdom and goodness of the Creator who gives him mastery over his 
acts and the ability to govern himself with a view to the true and the good. The natural law 
expresses the original moral sense which enables man to discern by reason the good and the evil, 
the truth and the lie: (307, 1776 1 

The natural law is written and engraved in the soul of each and every man, because it is human 
reason ordaining him to do good and forbidding him to sin... But this command of human 
reason would not have the force of law if it were not the voice and interpreter of a higher 
reason to which our spirit and our freedom must be submitted.^ 

1955 The “divine and natural” law§ shows man the way to follow so as to practice the good and 
attain his end. The natural law states the first and essential precepts which govern the moral life. It 
hinges upon the desire for God and submission to him, who is the source and judge of all that is 
good, as well as upon the sense that the other is one’s equal. Its principal precepts are expressed in 
the Decalogue. This law is called “natural,” not in reference to the nature of irrational beings, but 
because reason which decrees it properly belongs to human nature: ( 1787 . 396 . 2070 1 

Where then are these rules written, if not in the book of that light we call the truth? In it is 
written every just law; from it the law passes into the heart of the man who does justice, not 
that it migrates into it, but that it places its imprint on it, like a seal on a ring that passes onto 
wax, without leaving the ring.? 

The natural law is nothing other than the light of understanding placed in us by God; through 
it we know what we must do and what we must avoid. God has given this light or law at the 
creation.^ 

1956 The natural law, present in the heart of each man and established by reason, is universal in its 
precepts and its authority extends to all men. It expresses the dignity of the person and determines 
the basis for his fundamental rights and duties: 1 2261 1 

For there is a true law: right reason. It is in conformity with nature, is diffused among all men, 
and is immutable and eternal; its orders summon to duty; its prohibitions turn away from 
offense.... To replace it with a contrary law is a sacrilege; failure to apply even one of its 









provisions is forbidden; no one can abrogate it entirely .2 

1957 Application of the natural law varies greatly; it can demand reflection that takes account of 
various conditions of life according to places, times, and circumstances. Nevertheless, in the 
diversity of cultures, the natural law remains as a rule that binds men among themselves and 
imposes on them, beyond the inevitable differences, common principles. 

1958 The natural law is immutable and permanent throughout the variations of history; 12 it subsists 
under the flux of ideas and customs and supports their progress. The rules that express it remain 
substantially valid. Even when it is rejected in its very principles, it cannot be destroyed or removed 
from the heart of man. It always rises again in the life of individuals and societies: (2072) 

Theft is surely punished by your law, O Lord, and by the law that is written in the human 
heart, the law that iniquity itself does not efface.!! 

1959 The natural law, the Creator’s very good work, provides the solid foundation on which man 
can build the structure of moral rules to guide his choices. It also provides the indispensable moral 
foundation for building the human community. Finally, it provides the necessary basis for the civil 
law with which it is connected, whether by a reflection that draws conclusions from its principles, 
or by additions of a positive and juridical nature. ( 1879 ) 

1960 The precepts of natural law are not perceived by everyone clearly and immediately. In the 
present situation sinful man needs grace and revelation so moral and religious truths may be known 
“by everyone with facility, with firm certainty and with no admixture of error.” 12 The natural law 
provides revealed law and grace with a foundation prepared by God and in accordance with the 
work of the Spirit. 12071 . 37) 

II. The Old Law 

1961 God, our Creator and Redeemer, chose Israel for himself to be his people and revealed his 
Law to them, thus preparing for the coming of Christ. The Law of Moses expresses many truths 
naturally accessible to reason. These are stated and authenticated within the covenant of salvation. 
(62) 

1962 The Old Law is the first stage of revealed Law. Its moral prescriptions are summed up in the 
Ten Commandments. The precepts of the Decalogue lay the foundations for the vocation of man 
fashioned in the image of God; they prohibit what is contrary to the love of God and neighbor and 





prescribe what is essential to it. The Decalogue is a light offered to the conscience of every man to 
make God’s call and ways known to him and to protect him against evil: (2058) 


God wrote on the tables of the Law what men did not read in their hearts.!^ 

1963 According to Christian tradition, the Law is holy, spiritual, and good, 14 yet still imperfect. 
Like a tutorl^ it shows what must be done, but does not of itself give the strength, the grace of the 
Spirit, to fulfill it. Because of sin, which it cannot remove, it remains a law of bondage. According 
to St. Paul, its special function is to denounce and disclose sin, which constitutes a “law of 
concupiscence” in the human hearth However, the Law remains the first stage on the way to the 
kingdom. It prepares and disposes the chosen people and each Christian for conversion and faith in 
the Savior God. It provides a teaching which endures for ever, like the Word of God. ( 1610 . 2542 . 
2515 1 

1964 The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel. “The Law is a pedagogy and a prophecy of 
things to come.It prophesies and presages the work of liberation from sin which will be fulfilled 
in Christ: it provides the New Testament with images, “types,” and symbols for expressing the life 
according to the Spirit. Finally, the Law is completed by the teaching of the sapiential books and 
the prophets which set its course toward the New Covenant and the Kingdom of heaven. ( 122 . 
1828 1 

There were... under the regimen of the Old Covenant, people who possessed the charity and 
grace of the Holy Spirit and longed above all for the spiritual and eternal promises by which 
they were associated with the New Law. Conversely, there exist carnal men under the New 
Covenant, still distanced from the perfection of the New Law: the fear of punishment and 
certain temporal promises have been necessary, even under the New Covenant, to incite them 
to virtuous works. In any case, even though the Old Law prescribed charity, it did not give the 
Holy Spirit, through whom “God’s charity has been poured into our hearts. ”14 

III. The New Law or the Law of the Gospel 

1965 The New Law or the Law of the Gospel is the perfection here on earth of the divine law, 
natural and revealed. It is the work of Christ and is expressed particularly in the Sermon on the 
Mount. It is also the work of the Holy Spirit and through him it becomes the interior law of charity: 
“I will establish a New Covenant with the house of Israel.... I will put my laws into their minds, and 
write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. ”14 (459, 581, 715 1 











1966 The New Law is the grace of the Holy Spirit given to the faithful through faith in Christ. It 
works through charity; it uses the Sermon on the Mount to teach us what must be done and makes 
use of the sacraments to give us the grace to do it: ( 1999 1 

If anyone should meditate with devotion and perspicacity on the sermon our Lord gave on the 
mount, as we read in the Gospel of Saint Matthew, he will doubtless find there... the perfect 
way of the Christian life.... This sermon contains... all the precepts needed to shape one’s 
life.^2 


1967 The Law of the Gospel “fulfills,” refines, surpasses, and leads the Old Law to its perfection.^! 
In the Beatitudes, the New Law fulfills the divine promises by elevating and orienting them toward 
the “kingdom of heaven.” It is addressed to those open to accepting this new hope with faith—the 
poor, the humble, the afflicted, the pure of heart, those persecuted on account of Christ—and so 
marks out the surprising ways of the Kingdom. (577) 

1968 The Law of the Gospel fulfills the commandments of the Law. The Lord’s Sermon on the 
Mount, far from abolishing or devaluing the moral prescriptions of the Old Law, releases their 
hidden potential and has new demands arise from them: it reveals their entire divine and human 
truth. It does not add new external precepts, but proceeds to reform the heart, the root of human 
acts, where man chooses between the pure and the impure , 22 where faith, hope, and charity are 
formed and with them the other virtues. The Gospel thus brings the Law to its fullness through 
imitation of the perfection of the heavenly Father, through forgiveness of enemies and prayer for 
persecutors, in emulation of the divine generosity.^ ( 129 . 582 1 

1969 The New Law practices the acts of religion: almsgiving, prayer and fasting, directing them to 
the “Father who sees in secret,” in contrast with the desire to “be seen by men.”!4 its prayer is the 
Our Father.^ (1434 ) 

1970 The Law of the Gospel requires us to make the decisive choice between “the two ways” and 
to put into practice the words of the Lord.^h It is summed up in the Golden Rule, “Whatever you 
wish that men would do to you, do so to them; this is the law and the prophets. ”2! 1 1696 . 1789 . 
1823 1 

The entire Law of the Gospel is contained in the “new commandment” of Jesus, to love one 
another as he has loved us.2£ 

1971 To the Lord’s Sermon on the Mount it is fitting to add the moral catechesis of the apostolic 
teachings, such as Romans 12-15, 1 Corinthians 12-13, Colossians 3-4, Ephesians 4-5, etc. This 










doctrine hands on the Lord’s teaching with the authority of the apostles, particularly in the 
presentation of the virtues that flow from faith in Christ and are animated by charity, the principal 
gift of the Holy Spirit. “Let charity be genuine.... Love one another with brotherly affection.... 
Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the 
saints, practice hospitality.”^ This catechesis also teaches us to deal with cases of conscience in the 
light of our relationship to Christ and to the Church.^ (1789) 

1972 The New Law is called a law of love because it makes us act out of the love infused by the 
Holy Spirit, rather than from fear; a law of grace, because it confers the strength of grace to act, by 
means of faith and the sacraments; a law of freedom, because it sets us free from the ritual and 
juridical observances of the Old Law, inclines us to act spontaneously by the prompting of charity 
and, finally, lets us pass from the condition of a servant who “does not know what his master is 
doing” to that of a friend of Christ — “For all that I have heard from my Father I have made known 
to you”—or even to the status of son and heir.^i ( 782 . 1828 1 

1973 Besides its precepts, the New Law also includes the evangelical counsels. The traditional 
distinction between God’s commandments and the evangelical counsels is drawn in relation to 
charity, the perfection of Christian life. The precepts are intended to remove whatever is 
incompatible with charity. The aim of the counsels is to remove whatever might hinder the 
development of charity, even if it is not contrary to it.22 (2053, 915 1 

1974 The evangelical counsels manifest the living fullness of charity, which is never satisfied with 
not giving more. They attest its vitality and call forth our spiritual readiness. The perfection of the 
New Law consists essentially in the precepts of love of God and neighbor. The counsels point out 
the more direct ways, the readier means, and are to be practiced in keeping with the vocation of 
each: 1 2013 1 

[God] does not want each person to keep all the counsels, but only those appropriate to the 
diversity of persons, times, opportunities, and strengths, as charity requires; for it is charity, as 
queen of all virtues, all commandments, all counsels, and, in short, of all laws and all Christian 
actions, that gives to all of them their rank, order, time, and valued 


IN BRIEF 


1975 According to Scripture the Law is a fatherly instruction by God which prescribes for man the 










ways that lead to the promised beatitude, and proscribes the ways of evil. 


1976 “Law is an ordinance of reason for the common good, promulgated by the one who is in 
charge of the community” (St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 90, 4). 

1977 Christ is the end of the law (cf. Rom 10:4); only he teaches and bestows the justice of God. 

1978 The natural law is a participation in God’s wisdom and goodness by man formed in the image 
of his Creator. It expresses the dignity of the human person and forms the basis of his fundamental 
rights and duties. 

1979 The natural law is immutable, permanent throughout history. The rules that express it remain 
substantially valid. It is a necessary foundation for the erection of moral rules and civil law. 

1980 The Old Law is the first stage of revealed law. Its moral prescriptions are summed up in the 
Ten Commandments. 

1981 The Law of Moses contains many truths naturally accessible to reason. God has revealed 
them because men did not read them in their hearts. 

1982 The Old Law is a preparation for the Gospel. 

1983 The New Law is the grace of the Holy Spirit received by faith in Christ, operating through 
charity. It finds expression above all in the Lord’s Sermon on the Mount and uses the sacraments to 
communicate grace to us. 

1984 The Law of the Gospel fulfills and surpasses the Old Law and brings it to perfection: its 
promises, through the Beatitudes of the Kingdom of heaven; its commandments, by reforming the 
heart, the root of human acts. 

1985 The New Law is a law of love, a law of grace, a law of freedom. 

1986 Besides its precepts the New Law includes the evangelical counsels. “The Church’s holiness 
is fostered in a special way by the manifold counsels which the Lord proposes to his disciples in the 
Gospel” (LG 42 §2). 


ARTICLE 2 

GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION 





I. Justification 


1987 The grace of the Holy Spirit has the power to justify us, that is, to cleanse us from our sins 
and to communicate to us “the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ” and through 
Baptism:^ (734 ) 

But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that 
Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over 
him. The death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you 
also must consider yourselves as dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. 25 

1988 Through the power of the Holy Spirit we take part in Christ’s Passion by dying to sin, and in 
his Resurrection by being born to a new life; we are members of his Body which is the Church, 
branches grafted onto the vine which is himself ( 654 . 460) 

[God] gave himself to us through his Spirit. By the participation of the Spirit, we become 
communicants in the divine nature.... For this reason, those in whom the Spirit dwells are 
divinized.— 


1989 The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion, effecting justification in 
accordance with Jesus’ proclamation at the beginning of the Gospel: “Repent, for the kingdom of 
heaven is at hand.”22 Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, thus accepting 
forgiveness and righteousness from on high. “Justification is not only the remission of sins, but also 
the sanctification and renewal of the interior man.”22 ( 1427 1 

1990 Justification detaches man from sin which contradicts the love of God, and purifies his heart 
of sin. Justification follows upon God’s merciful initiative of offering forgiveness. It reconciles 
man with God. It frees from the enslavement to sin, and it heals. ( 1446 . 1733 1 

1991 Justification is at the same time the acceptance of God’s righteousness through faith in Jesus 
Christ. Righteousness (or “justice”) here means the rectitude of divine love. With justification, 
faith, hope, and charity are poured into our hearts, and obedience to the divine will is granted us. 
( 1812 1 

1992 Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ who offered himself on the cross 
as a living victim, holy and pleasing to God, and whose blood has become the instrument of 











atonement for the sins of all men. Justification is conferred in Baptism, the sacrament of faith. It 
conforms us to the righteousness of God, who makes us inwardly just by the power of his mercy. 
Its purpose is the glory of God and of Christ, and the gift of eternal life;4Q ( 617 . 1266 . 294 1 

But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law, although the law and 
the prophets bear witness to it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all 
who believe. For there is no distinction: since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of 
God, they are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus, 
whom God put forward as an expiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show 
God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins; it was 
to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies him who has faith 
in Jesus.41 

1993 Justification establishes cooperation between God’s grace and man’s freedom. On man’s part 
it is expressed by the assent of faith to the Word of God, which invites him to conversion, and in 
the cooperation of charity with the prompting of the Holy Spirit who precedes and preserves his 
assent: 1 2008 . 2068 1 

When God touches man’s heart through the illumination of the Holy Spirit, man himself is not 
inactive while receiving that inspiration, since he could reject it; and yet, without God’s grace, 
he cannot by his own free will move himself toward justice in God’s sight.42 

1994 Justification is the most excellent work of God’s love made manifest in Christ Jesus and 
granted by the Holy Spirit. It is the opinion of St. Augustine that “the justification of the wicked is 
a greater work than the creation of heaven and earth,” because “heaven and earth will pass away 
but the salvation and justification of the elect... will not pass away. ”42 He holds also that the 
justification of sinners surpasses the creation of the angels in justice, in that it bears witness to a 
greater mercy. ( 312 . 412 1 

1995 The Holy Spirit is the master of the interior life. By giving birth to the “inner man, 
justification entails the sanctification of his whole being: 1 741 1 

Just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now 
yield your members to righteousness for sanctification.... But now that you have been set free 
from sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is sanctification and its end, 
eternal life.45 










II. Grace 


1996 Our justification comes from the grace of God. Grace is favor, the free and undeserved help 
that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God, adoptive sons, partakers of the 
divine nature and of eternal life.^ (153 ) 

1997 Grace is a participation in the life of God. It introduces us into the intimacy of Trinitarian life: 
by Baptism the Christian participates in the grace of Christ, the Head of his Body. As an “adopted 
son” he can henceforth call God “Father,” in union with the only Son. He receives the life of the 
Spirit who breathes charity into him and who forms the Church. (375, 260) 

1998 This vocation to eternal life is supernatural. It depends entirely on God’s gratuitous initiative, 
for he alone can reveal and give himself. It surpasses the power of human intellect and will, as that 
of every other creature.^ ( 1719 ) 

1999 The grace of Christ is the gratuitous gift that God makes to us of his own life, infused by the 
Holy Spirit into our soul to heal it of sin and to sanctify it. It is the sanctifying or deifying grace 
received in Baptism. It is in us the source of the work of sanctification:^ (1966) 

Therefore if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold, the 
new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself.^ 

2000 Sanctifying grace is an habitual gift, a stable and supernatural disposition that perfects the 
soul itself to enable it to live with God, to act by his love. Habitual grace, the permanent 
disposition to live and act in keeping with God’s call, is distinguished from actual graces which 
refer to God’s interventions, whether at the beginning of conversion or in the course of the work of 
sanctification. 

2001 The preparation of man for the reception of grace is already a work of grace. This latter is 
needed to arouse and sustain our collaboration in justification through faith, and in sanctification 
through charity. God brings to completion in us what he has begun, “since he who completes his 
work by cooperating with our will began by working so that we might will it:”^ (490) 

Indeed we also work, but we are only collaborating with God who works, for his mercy has 
gone before us. It has gone before us so that we may be healed, and follows us so that once 
healed, we may be given life; it goes before us so that we may be called, and follows us so that 
we may be glorified; it goes before us so that we may live devoutly, and follows us so that we 








may always live with God: for without him we can do nothing.^! 

2002 God’s free initiative demands man’s free response, for God has created man in his image by 
conferring on him, along with freedom, the power to know him and love him. The soul only enters 
freely into the communion of love. God immediately touches and directly moves the heart of man. 
He has placed in man a longing for truth and goodness that only he can satisfy. The promises of 
“eternal life” respond, beyond all hope, to this desire: (1742 . 2550) 

If at the end of your very good works... , you rested on the seventh day, it was to foretell by 
the voice of your book that at the end of our works, which are indeed “very good” since you 
have given them to us, we shall also rest in you on the sabbath of eternal life.^ 

2003 Grace is first and foremost the gift of the Spirit who justifies and sanctifies us. But grace also 
includes the gifts that the Spirit grants us to associate us with his work, to enable us to collaborate 
in the salvation of others and in the growth of the Body of Christ, the Church. There are 
sacramental graces, gifts proper to the different sacraments. There are furthermore special graces, 
also called charisms after the Greek term used by St. Paul and meaning “favor,” “gratuitous gift,” 
“benefit.”^ Whatever their character—sometimes it is extraordinary, such as the gift of miracles or 
of tongues—charisms are oriented toward sanctifying grace and are intended for the common good 
of the Church. They are at the service of charity which builds up the Church.^ ( 1108 . 1127 . 799- 
801 1 

2004 Among the special graces ought to be mentioned the graces of state that accompany the 
exercise of the responsibilities of the Christian life and of the ministries within the Church: 

Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in 
proportion to our faith; if service, in our serving; he who teaches, in his teaching; he who 
exhorts, in his exhortation; he who contributes, in liberality; he who gives aid, with zeal; he 
who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.^ 

2005 Since it belongs to the supernatural order, grace escapes our experience and cannot be known 
except by faith. We cannot therefore rely on our feelings or our works to conclude that we are 
justified and saved.^ However, according to the Lord’s words — “Thus you will know them by 
their fruits”^—reflection on God’s blessings in our life and in the lives of the saints offers us a 
guarantee that grace is at work in us and spurs us on to an ever greater faith and an attitude of 
trustful poverty. 








A pleasing illustration of this attitude is found in the reply of St. Joan of Arc to a question 
posed as a trap by her ecclesiastical judges: “Asked if she knew that she was in God’s grace, 
she replied: ‘If I am not, may it please God to put me in it; if I am, may it please God to keep 
me there. 

III. Merit 

You are glorified in the assembly of your Holy Ones, for in crowning their merits you are 
crowning your own gifts.^ 

2006 The term “merit” refers in general to the recompense owed by a community or a society for 
the action of one of its members, experienced either as beneficial or harmful, deserving reward or 
punishment. Merit is relative to the virtue of justice, in conformity with the principle of equality 
which governs it. ( 1723 . 1807 ) 

2007 With regard to God, there is no strict right to any merit on the part of man. Between God and 
us there is an immeasurable inequality, for we have received everything from him, our Creator. (42) 

2008 The merit of man before God in the Christian life arises from the fact that God has freely 
chosen to associate man with the work of his grace. The fatherly action of God is first on his own 
initiative, and then follows man’s free acting through his collaboration, so that the merit of good 
works is to be attributed in the first place to the grace of God, then to the faithful. Man’s merit, 
moreover, itself is due to God, for his good actions proceed in Christ, from the predispositions and 
assistance given by the Holy Spirit. ( 306 . 155 . 970 ) 

2009 Filial adoption, in making us partakers by grace in the divine nature, can bestow true merit on 
us as a result of God’s gratuitous justice. This is our right by grace, the full right of love, making us 
“co-heirs” with Christ and worthy of obtaining “the promised inheritance of eternal life.”h2 The 
merits of our good works are gifts of the divine goodness.^1 “Grace has gone before us; now we are 
given what is due.... Our merits are God’s gifts.”^ (604) 

2010 Since the initiative belongs to God in the order of grace, no one can merit the initial grace of 
forgiveness and justification, at the beginning of conversion. Moved by the Holy Spirit and by 
charity, we can then merit for ourselves and for others the graces needed for our sanctification, for 
the increase of grace and charity, and for the attainment of eternal life. Even temporal goods like 
health and friendship can be merited in accordance with God’s wisdom. These graces and goods are 
the object of Christian prayer. Prayer attends to the grace we need for meritorious actions. ( 1998 1 









2011 The charity of Christ is the source in us of all our merits before God. Grace, by uniting us to 
Christ in active love, ensures the supernatural quality of our acts and consequently their merit 
before God and before men. The saints have always had a lively awareness that their merits were 
pure grace. (492, 1460 1 

After earth’s exile, I hope to go and enjoy you in the fatherland, but I do not want to lay up 
merits for heaven. I want to work for your love alone.... In the evening of this life, I shall 
appear before you with empty hands, for I do not ask you, Lord, to count my works. All our 
justice is blemished in your eyes. I wish, then, to be clothed in your own justice and to receive 
from your love the eternal possession of yourselfM 

IV. Christian Holiness 

2012 “We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him... For those whom 
he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be 
the first-born among many brethren. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those 
whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.”^ (459) 

2013 “All Christians in any state or walk of life are called to the fullness of Christian life and to the 
perfection of charity.”^ All are called to holiness: “Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is 
perfect.”^ (915, 2545, 825) 

In order to reach this perfection the faithful should use the strength dealt out to them by 
Christ’s gift, so that... doing the will of the Father in everything, they may wholeheartedly 
devote themselves to the glory of God and to the service of their neighbor. Thus the holiness 
of the People of God will grow in fruitful abundance, as is clearly shown in the history of the 
Church through the lives of so many saints.^ 

2014 Spiritual progress tends toward ever more intimate union with Christ. This union is called 
“mystical” because it participates in the mystery of Christ through the sacraments — “the holy 
mysteries” — and, in him, in the mystery of the Holy Trinity. God calls us all to this intimate union 
with him, even if the special graces or extraordinary signs of this mystical life are granted only to 
some for the sake of manifesting the gratuitous gift given to all. ( 774 ) 

2015 The way of perfection passes by way of the Cross. There is no holiness without renunciation 
and spiritual battle.^ Spiritual progress entails the ascesis and mortification that gradually lead to 
living in the peace and joy of the Beatitudes: 1 407 . 2725 . 1438 1 












He who climbs never stops going from beginning to beginning, through beginnings that have 
no end. He never stops desiring what he already knows.hS 

2016 The children of our holy mother the Church rightly hope for the grace of final perseverance 
and the recompense of God their Father for the good works accomplished with his grace in 
communion with Jesus.^ Keeping the same rule of life, believers share the “blessed hope” of those 
whom the divine mercy gathers into the “holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven 
from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.”^ ( 162 . 1821 . 1274 1 


IN BRIEF 

2017 The grace of the Holy Spirit confers upon us the righteousness of God. Uniting us by faith 
and Baptism to the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, the Spirit makes us sharers in his life. 

2018 Like conversion, justification has two aspects. Moved by grace, man turns toward God and 
away from sin, and so accepts forgiveness and righteousness from on high. 

2019 Justification includes the remission of sins, sanctification, and the renewal of the inner man. 

2020 Justification has been merited for us by the Passion of Christ. It is granted us through 
Baptism. It conforms us to the righteousness of God, who justifies us. It has for its goal the glory of 
God and of Christ, and the gift of eternal life. It is the most excellent work of God’s mercy. 

2021 Grace is the help God gives us to respond to our vocation of becoming his adopted sons. It 
introduces us into the intimacy of the Trinitarian life. 

2022 The divine initiative in the work of grace precedes, prepares, and elicits the free response of 
man. Grace responds to the deepest yearnings of human freedom, calls freedom to cooperate with 
it, and perfects freedom. 

2023 Sanctifying grace is the gratuitous gift of his life that God makes to us; it is infused by the 
Holy Spirit into the soul to heal it of sin and to sanctify it. 

2024 Sanctifying grace makes us “pleasing to God.” Charisms, special graces of the Holy Spirit, 
are oriented to sanctifying grace and are intended for the common good of the Church. God also 
acts through many actual graces, to be distinguished from habitual grace which is permanent in us. 







2025 We can have merit in God’s sight only because of God’s free plan to associate man with the 
work of his grace. Merit is to be ascribed in the first place to the grace of God, and secondly to 
man’s collaboration. Man’s merit is due to God. 

2026 The grace of the Holy Spirit can confer true merit on us, by virtue of our adoptive filiation, 
and in accordance with God’s gratuitous justice. Charity is the principal source of merit in us 
before God. 

2027 No one can merit the initial grace which is at the origin of conversion. Moved by the Holy 
Spirit, we can merit for ourselves and for others all the graces needed to attain eternal life, as well 
as necessary temporal goods. 

2028 “All Christians... are called to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity” 
(LG 40 § 2). “Christian perfection has but one limit, that of having none” (St. Gregory of Nyssa, De 
vita Mos.: PG 44, 300D). 

2029 “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me” 
(Mt 16:24). 


ARTICLE 3 

THE CHURCH, MOTHER AND TEACHER 


2030 It is in the Church, in communion with all the baptized, that the Christian fulfills his vocation. 
From the Church he receives the Word of God containing the teachings of “the law of Christ.”^ 
From the Church he receives the grace of the sacraments that sustains him on the “way.” From the 
Church he learns the example of holiness and recognizes its model and source in the all-holy Virgin 
Mary; he discerns it in the authentic witness of those who live it; he discovers it in the spiritual 
tradition and long history of the saints who have gone before him and whom the liturgy celebrates 
in the rhythms of the sanctoral cycle. (828, 1172 ) 

2031 The moral life is spiritual worship. We “present [our) bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and 
acceptable to God,”— within the Body of Christ that we form and in communion with the offering 
of his Eucharist. In the liturgy and the celebration of the sacraments, prayer and teaching are 
conjoined with the grace of Christ to enlighten and nourish Christian activity. As does the whole of 
the Christian life, the moral life finds its source and summit in the Eucharistic sacrifice. (1368) 









I. Moral Life and the Magisterium of the Church 85-87 . 888-892 


2032 The Church, the “pillar and bulwark of the truth,” “has received this solemn command of 
Christ from the apostles to announce the saving truth.” '4 “To the Church belongs the right always 
and everywhere to announce moral principles, including those pertaining to the social order, and to 
make judgments on any human affairs to the extent that they are required by the fundamental rights 
of the human person or the salvation of souls. (2246, 2420 1 

2033 The Magisterium of the Pastors of the Church in moral matters is ordinarily exercised in 
catechesis and preaching, with the help of the works of theologians and spiritual authors. Thus from 
generation to generation, under the aegis and vigilance of the pastors, the “deposit” of Christian 
moral teaching has been handed on, a deposit composed of a characteristic body of rules, 
commandments, and virtues proceeding from faith in Christ and animated by charity. Alongside the 
Creed and the Our Father, the basis for this catechesis has traditionally been the Decalogue which 
sets out the principles of moral life valid for all men. (84) 

2034 The Roman Pontiff and the bishops are “authentic teachers, that is, teachers endowed with the 
authority of Christ, who preach the faith to the people entrusted to them, the faith to be believed 
and put into practice.” § The ordinary and universal Magisterium of the Pope and the bishops in 
communion with him teach the faithful the truth to believe, the charity to practice, the beatitude to 
hope for. 

2035 The supreme degree of participation in the authority of Christ is ensured by the charism of 
infallibility. This infallibility extends as far as does the deposit of divine Revelation; it also extends 
to all those elements of doctrine, including morals, without which the saving truths of the faith 
cannot be preserved, explained, or observed.22 

2036 The authority of the Magisterium extends also to the specific precepts of the natural law, 
because their observance, demanded by the Creator, is necessary for salvation. In recalling the 
prescriptions of the natural law, the Magisterium of the Church exercises an essential part of its 
prophetic office of proclaiming to men what they truly are and reminding them of what they should 
be before God.^ ( 1960 1 

2037 The law of God entrusted to the Church is taught to the faithful as the way of life and truth. 
The faithful therefore have the right to be instructed in the divine saving precepts that purify 
judgment and, with grace, heal wounded human reason.^9 They have the duty of observing the 







constitutions and decrees conveyed by the legitimate authority of the Church. Even if they concern 
disciplinary matters, these determinations call for docility in charity. (2041) 

2038 In the work of teaching and applying Christian morality, the Church needs the dedication of 
pastors, the knowledge of theologians, and the contribution of all Christians and men of good will. 
Faith and the practice of the Gospel provide each person with an experience of life “in Christ,” who 
enlightens him and makes him able to evaluate the divine and human realities according to the 
Spirit of God.^2 Thus the Holy Spirit can use the humblest to enlighten the learned and those in the 
highest positions. (2442) 

2039 Ministries should be exercised in a spirit of fraternal service and dedication to the Church, in 
the name of the Lord.^1 At the same time the conscience of each person should avoid confining 
itself to individualistic considerations in its moral judgments of the person’s own acts. As far as 
possible conscience should take account of the good of all, as expressed in the moral law, natural 
and revealed, and consequently in the law of the Church and in the authoritative teaching of the 
Magisterium on moral questions. Personal conscience and reason should not be set in opposition to 
the moral law or the Magisterium of the Church. (1783) 

2040 Thus a true filial spirit toward the Church can develop among Christians. It is the normal 
flowering of the baptismal grace which has begotten us in the womb of the Church and made us 
members of the Body of Christ. In her motherly care, the Church grants us the mercy of God which 
prevails over ah our sins and is especially at work in the sacrament of reconciliation. With a 
mother’s foresight, she also lavishes on us day after day in her liturgy the nourishment of the Word 
and Eucharist of the Lord. (167) 

II. The Precepts of the Church 

2041 The precepts of the Church are set in the context of a moral life bound to and nourished by 
liturgical life. The obligatory character of these positive laws decreed by the pastoral authorities is 
meant to guarantee to the faithful the very necessary minimum in the spirit of prayer and moral 
effort, in the growth in love of God and neighbor: 

2042 The first precept (“You shall attend Mass on Sundays and on holy days of obligation and rest 
from servile labor”) requires the faithful to sanctify the day commemorating the Resurrection of the 
Lord as well as the principal liturgical feasts honoring the mysteries of the Lord, the Blessed Virgin 
Mary, and the saints; in the first place, by participating in the Eucharistic celebration, in which the 






Christian community is gathered, and by resting from those works and activities which could 
impede such a sanctification of these days.^ ( 1389 . 2180 . 1457 . 1389) 

The second precept (“You shall confess your sins at least once a year.”) ensures preparation 
for the Eucharist by the reception of the sacrament of reconciliation, which continues Baptism’s 
work of conversion and forgiveness.^ 

The third precept (“You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least during the Easter 
season”) guarantees as a minimum the reception of the Lord’s Body and Blood in connection with 
the Paschal feasts, the origin and center of the Christian liturgy.^! 

2043 The fourth precept (“You shall observe the days of fasting and abstinence established by the 
Church”) ensures the times of ascesis and penance which prepare us for the liturgical feasts and 
help us acquire mastery over our instincts and freedom of hearth ( 2177 . 1387 . 1438 . 1351 1 

The fifth precept (“You shall help to provide for the needs of the Church”) means that the 
faithful are obliged to assist with the material needs of the Church, each according to his own 
ability.^ 

The faithful also have the duty of providing for the material needs of the Church, each 
according to his abilities.^ 

III. Moral Life and Missionary Witness 

2044 The fidelity of the baptized is a primordial condition for the proclamation of the Gospel and 
for the Church’s mission in the world. In order that the message of salvation can show the power of 
its truth and radiance before men, it must be authenticated by the witness of the life of Christians. 
“The witness of a Christian life and good works done in a supernatural spirit have great power to 
draw men to the faith and to God.”^ ( 852 . 905 1 

2045 Because they are members of the Body whose Head is Christ,^ Christians contribute to 
building up the Church by the constancy of their convictions and their moral lives. The Church 
increases, grows, and develops through the holiness of her faithful, until “we all attain to the unity 
of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the 
stature of the fullness of Christ.”^ ( 753 . 828 1 

2046 By living with the mind of Christ, Christians hasten the coming of the Reign of God, “a 
kingdom of justice, love, and peace. ”21 They do not, for all that, abandon their earthly tasks; 
faithful to their master, they fulfill them with uprightness, patience, and love. (671, 2819 1 


















IN BRIEF 


2047 The moral life is a spiritual worship. Christian activity finds its nourishment in the liturgy and 
the celebration of the sacraments. 

2048 The precepts of the Church concern the moral and Christian life united with the liturgy and 
nourished by it. 

2049 The Magisterium of the Pastors of the Church in moral matters is ordinarily exercised in 
catechesis and preaching, on the basis of the Decalogue which states the principles of moral life 
valid for every man. 

2050 The Roman Pontiff and the bishops, as authentic teachers, preach to the People of God the 
faith which is to be believed and applied in moral life. It is also incumbent on them to pronounce on 
moral questions that fall within the natural law and reason. 

2051 The infallibility of the Magisterium of the Pastors extends to all the elements of doctrine, 
including moral doctrine, without which the saving truths of the faith cannot be preserved, 
expounded, or observed.

SECTION TWO 
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS 


“Teacher, what must I do... ?” 

2052 “Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?” To the young man who asked this 
question, Jesus answers first by invoking the necessity to recognize God as the “One there is who is 
good,” as the supreme Good and the source of all good. Then Jesus tells him: “If you would enter 
life, keep the commandments.” And he cites for his questioner the precepts that concern love of 
neighbor: “You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not 
bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.” Finally Jesus sums up these commandments 
positively: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ”i ( 1858 1 

2053 To this first reply Jesus adds a second: “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess 
and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”2 This reply does 
not do away with the first: following Jesus Christ involves keeping the Commandments. The Law 
has not been abolished, 2 but rather man is invited to rediscover it in the person of his Master who is 
its perfect fulfillment. In the three synoptic Gospels, Jesus’ call to the rich young man to follow 
him, in the obedience of a disciple and in the observance of the Commandments, is joined to the 
call to poverty and chastity.^ The evangelical counsels are inseparable from the Commandments. 
( 1968 . 1973 1 

2054 Jesus acknowledged the Ten Commandments, but he also showed the power of the Spirit at 
work in their letter. He preached a “righteousness [which] exceeds that of the scribes and 
Pharisees”^ as well as that of the Gentiles.^ He unfolded all the demands of the Commandments. 
“You have heard that it was said to the men of old, ‘You shall not kill.’... But I say to you that 
every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment.”^ ( 581 1 

2055 When someone asks him, “Which commandment in the Law is the greatest?”^ Jesus replies: 
“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your 
mind. This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your 
neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the prophets. ”2 The 
Decalogue must be interpreted in light of this twofold yet single commandment of love, the fullness 
of the Law: ( 129 1 







The commandments: “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, 
You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence: “You 
shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the 
fulfilling of the law.^2 

The Decalogue in Sacred Scripture 

2056 The word “Decalogue” means literally “ten words.God revealed these “ten words” to his 
people on the holy mountain. They were written “with the finger of God, ”12 unlike the other 
commandments written by Moses.12 They are pre-eminently the words of God. They are handed 
on to us in the books of Exodus 14 and Deuteronomy.^ Beginning with the Old Testament, the 
sacred books refer to the “ten words,but it is in the New Covenant in Jesus Christ that their full 
meaning will be revealed. ( 700 . 62) 

2057 The Decalogue must first be understood in the context of the Exodus, God’s great liberating 
event at the center of the Old Covenant. Whether formulated as negative commandments, 
prohibitions, or as positive precepts such as: “Honor your father and mother,” the “ten words” point 
out the conditions of a life freed from the slavery of sin. The Decalogue is a path of life: ( 2084 . 
2170 1 

If you love the LORD your God, by walking in his ways, and by keeping his commandments 
and his statutes and his ordinances, then you shall live and multiply.!^ 

This liberating power of the Decalogue appears, for example, in the commandment about the 
sabbath rest, directed also to foreigners and slaves: 

You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God 
brought you out thence with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.lS 

2058 The “ten words” sum up and proclaim God’s law: “These words the LORD spoke to all your 
assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud 
voice; and he added no more. And he wrote them upon two tablets of stone, and gave them to 
me. ”19 For this reason these two tablets are called “the Testimony.” In fact, they contain the terms 
of the covenant concluded between God and his people. These “tablets of the Testimony” were to 
be deposited in “the ark.”2Q ( 1962 1 

2059 The “ten words” are pronounced by God in the midst of a theophany (“The LORD spoke with 
you face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the fire. ”21). They belong to God’s revelation 






of himself and his glory. The gift of the Commandments is the gift of God himself and his holy 
will. In making his will known, God reveals himself to his people. (707, 2823 1 

2060 The gift of the commandments and of the Law is part of the covenant God sealed with his 
own. In Exodus, the revelation of the “ten words” is granted between the proposal of the covenant^ 
and its conclusion—after the people had committed themselves to “do” all that the Lord had said, 
and to “obey” it.^3 The Decalogue is never handed on without first recalling the covenant (“The 
LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.”).^ (62) 

2061 The Commandments take on their full meaning within the covenant. According to Scripture, 
man’s moral life has all its meaning in and through the covenant. The first of the “ten words” 
recalls that God loved his people first: (2086) 

Since there was a passing from the paradise of freedom to the slavery of this world, in 
punishment for sin, the first phrase of the Decalogue, the first word of God’s commandments, 
bears on freedom: “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out 
of the house of slavery.”^ 

2062 The Commandments properly so-called come in the second place: they express the 
implications of belonging to God through the establishment of the covenant. Moral existence is a 
response to the Lord’s loving initiative. It is the acknowledgement and homage given to God and a 
worship of thanksgiving. It is cooperation with the plan God pursues in history. ( 142 . 2002 1 

2063 The covenant and dialogue between God and man are also attested to by the fact that all the 
obligations are stated in the first person (“I am the Lord.”) and addressed by God to another 
personal subject (“you”). In all God’s commandments, the singular personal pronoun designates 
the recipient. God makes his will known to each person in particular, at the same time as he makes 
it known to the whole people: ( 878 1 

The Lord prescribed love towards God and taught justice towards neighbor, so that man would 
be neither unjust, nor unworthy of God. Thus, through the Decalogue, God prepared man to 
become his friend and to live in harmony with his neighbor.... The words of the Decalogue 
remain likewise for us Christians. Far from being abolished, they have received amplification 
and development from the fact of the coming of the Lord in the flesh.^ 


The Decalogue in the Church’s tradition 








2064 In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with the example of Jesus, the tradition of the 
Church has acknowledged the primordial importance and significance of the Decalogue. 

2065 Ever since St. Augustine, the Ten Commandments have occupied a predominant place in the 
catechesis of baptismal candidates and the faithful. In the fifteenth century, the custom arose of 
expressing the commandments of the Decalogue in rhymed formulae, easy to memorize and in 
positive form. They are still in use today. The catechisms of the Church have often expounded 
Christian morality by following the order of the Ten Commandments. 

2066 The division and numbering of the Commandments have varied in the course of history. The 
present catechism follows the division of the Commandments established by St. Augustine, which 
has become traditional in the Catholic Church. It is also that of the Lutheran confessions. The 
Greek Fathers worked out a slightly different division, which is found in the Orthodox Churches 
and Reformed communities. 

2067 The Ten Commandments state what is required in the love of God and love of neighbor. The 
first three concern love of God, and the other seven love of neighbor. (1853) 

As charity comprises the two commandments to which the Lord related the whole Law and the 
prophets... so the Ten Commandments were themselves given on two tablets. Three were 
written on one tablet and seven on the other .22 

2068 The Council of Trent teaches that the Ten Commandments are obligatory for Christians and 
that the justified man is still bound to keep them;2B the Second Vatican Council confirms: “The 
bishops, successors of the apostles, receive from the Lord... the mission of teaching all peoples, and 
of preaching the Gospel to every creature, so that all men may attain salvation through faith, 
Baptism and the observance of the Commandments.”^ ( 1993 . 888 1 

The unity of the Decalogue 

2069 The Decalogue forms a coherent whole. Each “word” refers to each of the others and to all of 
them; they reciprocally condition one another. The two tablets shed light on one another; they form 
an organic unity. To transgress one commandment is to infringe all the others.One cannot honor 
another person without blessing God his Creator. One cannot adore God without loving all men, his 
creatures. The Decalogue brings man’s religious and social life into unity. ( 2534 ) 


The Decalogue and the natural law 






2070 The Ten Commandments belong to God’s revelation. At the same time they teach us the true 
humanity of man. They bring to light the essential duties, and therefore, indirectly, the fundamental 
rights inherent in the nature of the human person. The Decalogue contains a privileged expression 
of the natural law: (1955) 

From the beginning, God had implanted in the heart of man the precepts of the natural law. 
Then he was content to remind him of them. This was the Decalogue. 21 

2071 The commandments of the Decalogue, although accessible to reason alone, have been 
revealed. To attain a complete and certain understanding of the requirements of the natural law, 
sinful humanity needed this revelation: ( 1960 . 1777 1 

A full explanation of the commandments of the Decalogue became necessary in the state of 
sin because the light of reason was obscured and the will had gone astray.22 

We know God’s commandments through the divine revelation proposed to us in the Church, and 
through the voice of moral conscience. 

The obligation of the Decalogue 

2072 Since they express man’s fundamental duties towards God and towards his neighbor, the Ten 
Commandments reveal, in their primordial content, grave obligations. They are fundamentally 
immutable, and they oblige always and everywhere. No one can dispense from them. The Ten 
Commandments are engraved by God in the human heart. ( 1858 . 1958 1 

2073 Obedience to the Commandments also implies obligations in matter which is, in itself, light. 
Thus abusive language is forbidden by the fifth commandment, but would be a grave offense only 
as a result of circumstances or the offender’s intention. 

“Apart from me you can do nothing ” 

2074 Jesus says: “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is 
that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.”^ The fruit referred to in this saying 
is the holiness of a life made fruitful by union with Christ. When we believe in Jesus Christ, partake 
of his mysteries, and keep his commandments, the Savior himself comes to love, in us, his Father 
and his brethren, our Father and our brethren. His person becomes, through the Spirit, the living 
and interior rule of our activity. “This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have 







loved you.”24 ( 2732 . 521) 


IN BRIEF 

2075 “What good deed must I do, to have eternal life?” — “If you would enter into life, keep the 
commandments” (Mt 19:16-17). 

2076 By his life and by his preaching Jesus attested to the permanent validity of the Decalogue. 

2077 The gift of the Decalogue is bestowed from within the covenant concluded by God with his 
people. God’s commandments take on their true meaning in and through this covenant. 

2078 In fidelity to Scripture and in conformity with Jesus’ example, the tradition of the Church has 
always acknowledged the primordial importance and significance of the Decalogue. 

2079 The Decalogue forms an organic unity in which each “word” or “commandment” refers to all 
the others taken together. To transgress one commandment is to infringe the whole Law (cf. Jas 
2 : 10 - 11 ). 

2080 The Decalogue contains a privileged expression of the natural law. It is made known to us by 
divine revelation and by human reason. 

2081 The Ten Commandments, in their fundamental content, state grave obligations. However, 
obedience to these precepts also implies obligations in matter which is, in itself, light. 

2082 What God commands he makes possible by his grace.

CHAPTER ONE 

“YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR 
HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR 

MIND” 

2083 Jesus summed up man’s duties toward God in this saying: “You shall love the Lord your God 
with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.”i This immediately echoes the 
solemn call: “Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD.”2 ( 367 .199) 

God has loved us first. The love of the One God is recalled in the first of the “ten words.” The 
commandments then make explicit the response of love that man is called to give to his God. 

ARTICLE 1 

THE FIRST COMMANDMENT 


I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of 
bondage. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a graven 
image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or 
that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them.3 

It is written: “You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve. 

I. “You Shall Worship the Lord Your God and Him Only Shall You Serve” 

2084 God makes himself known by recalling his all-powerful, loving, and liberating action in the 
history of the one he addresses: “I brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of 
bondage.” The first word contains the first commandment of the Law: “You shall fear the LORD 
your God; you shall serve him.... You shall not go after other gods.”^ God’s first call and just 
demand is that man accept him and worship him. 1 2057 . 398 1 

2085 The one and true God first reveals his glory to Israel.^ The revelation of the vocation and truth 
of man is linked to the revelation of God. Man’s vocation is to make God manifest by acting in 
conformity with his creation “in the image and likeness of God”: (200, 1701 1 


There will never be another God, Trypho, and there has been no other since the world began... 
than he who made and ordered the universe. We do not think that our God is different from 










yours. He is the same who brought your fathers out of Egypt “by his powerful hand and his 
outstretched arm.” We do not place our hope in some other god, for there is none, but in the 
same God as you do: the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 

2086 “The first commandment embraces faith, hope, and charity. When we say ‘God’ we confess a 
constant, unchangeable being, always the same, faithful and just, without any evil. It follows that 
we must necessarily accept his words and have complete faith in him and acknowledge his 
authority. He is almighty, merciful, and infinitely beneficent.... Who could not place all hope in 
him? Who could not love him when contemplating the treasures of goodness and love he has 
poured out on us? Hence the formula God employs in the Scripture at the beginning and end of his 
commandments: T am the LORD.’”^ 1 212 . 2061 1 

Faith 1814-1816 

2087 Our moral life has its source in faith in God who reveals his love to us. St. Paul speaks of the 
“obedience of faith”^ as our first obligation. He shows that “ignorance of God” is the principle and 
explanation of all moral deviations.^ Our duty toward God is to believe in him and to bear witness 
to him. (143) 

2088 The first commandment requires us to nourish and protect our faith with prudence and 
vigilance, and to reject everything that is opposed to it. There are various ways of sinning against 
faith: 1 157 1 

Voluntary doubt about the faith disregards or refuses to hold as true what God has revealed 
and the Church proposes for belief. Involuntary doubt refers to hesitation in believing, difficulty in 
overcoming objections connected with the faith, or also anxiety aroused by its obscurity. If 
deliberately cultivated doubt can lead to spiritual blindness. 

2089 Incredulity is the neglect of revealed truth or the willful refusal to assent to it. “Heresy is the 
obstinate post-baptismal denial of some truth which must be believed with divine and catholic faith, 
or it is likewise an obstinate doubt concerning the same; apostasy is the total repudiation of the 
Christian faith; schism is the refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff or of communion with the 
members of the Church subject to him.”Jd ( 162 . 817 1 

Hope 1817-1821 

2090 When God reveals Himself and calls him, man cannot fully respond to the divine love by his 
own powers. He must hope that God will give him the capacity to love Him in return and to act in 










conformity with the commandments of charity. Hope is the confident expectation of divine blessing 
and the beatific vision of God; it is also the fear of offending God’s love and of incurring 
punishment. (1996) 

2091 The first commandment is also concerned with sins against hope, namely, despair and 
presumption: (1864) 

By despair, man ceases to hope for his personal salvation from God, for help in attaining it or 
for the forgiveness of his sins. Despair is contrary to God’s goodness, to his justice—for the Lord is 
faithful to his promises—and to his mercy. 

2092 There are two kinds of presumption. Either man presumes upon his own capacities, (hoping to 
be able to save himself without help from on high), or he presumes upon God’s almighty power or 
his mercy (hoping to obtain his forgiveness without conversion and glory without merit). ( 2732 ) 

Charity 1822-1829 

2093 Faith in God’s love encompasses the call and the obligation to respond with sincere love to 
divine charity. The first commandment enjoins us to love God above everything and all creatures 
for him and because of him.12 

2094 One can sin against God’s love in various ways: 1 2733 . 2303) 

—indifference neglects or refuses to reflect on divine charity; it fails to consider its prevenient 
goodness and denies its power. 

—ingratitude fails or refuses to acknowledge divine charity and to return him love for love. 

—lukewarmness is hesitation or negligence in responding to divine love; it can imply refusal to 
give oneself over to the prompting of charity. 

—acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from God and to be 
repelled by divine goodness. 

—hatred of God comes from pride. It is contrary to love of God, whose goodness it denies, and 
whom it presumes to curse as the one who forbids sins and inflicts punishments. 

II. “Him Only Shall You Serve” 

2095 The theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity inform and give life to the moral virtues. 
Thus charity leads us to render to God what we as creatures owe him in all justice. The virtue of 
religion disposes us to have this attitude. (1807) 










Adoration 2628 


2096 Adoration is the first act of the virtue of religion. To adore God is to acknowledge him as 
God, as the Creator and Savior, the Lord and Master of everything that exists, as infinite and 
merciful Love. “You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve,” says Jesus, 
citing Deuteronomy.^ 

2097 To adore God is to acknowledge, in respect and absolute submission, the “nothingness of the 
creature” who would not exist but for God. To adore God is to praise and exalt him and to humble 
oneself, as Mary did in the Magnificat, confessing with gratitude that he has done great things and 
holy is his name.14 The worship of the one God sets man free from turning in on himself, from the 
slavery of sin and the idolatry of the world. 1 2807 1 

Prayer 2558 

2098 The acts of faith, hope, and charity enjoined by the first commandment are accomplished in 
prayer. Lifting up the mind toward God is an expression of our adoration of God: prayer of praise 
and thanksgiving, intercession and petition. Prayer is an indispensable condition for being able to 
obey God’s commandments. “[We] ought always to pray and not lose heart.”±^ (2742) 

Sacrifice 

2099 It is right to offer sacrifice to God as a sign of adoration and gratitude, supplication and 
communion: “Every action done so as to cling to God in communion of holiness, and thus achieve 
blessedness, is a true sacrifice.”^ ( 613 ) 

2100 Outward sacrifice, to be genuine, must be the expression of spiritual sacrifice: “The sacrifice 
acceptable to God is a broken spirit....”^ The prophets of the Old Covenant often denounced 
sacrifices that were not from the heart or not coupled with love of neighbor.^ Jesus recalls the 
words of the prophet Hosea: “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. ”1^ The only perfect sacrifice is the 
one that Christ offered on the cross as a total offering to the Father’s love and for our salvation.^ 
By uniting ourselves with his sacrifice we can make our lives a sacrifice to God. 1 2711 . 614 . 618 1 

Promises and vows 

2101 In many circumstances, the Christian is called to make promises to God. Baptism and 
Confirmation, Matrimony and Holy Orders always entail promises. Out of personal devotion, the 










Christian may also promise to God this action, that prayer, this alms-giving, that pilgrimage, and so 
forth. Fidelity to promises made to God is a sign of the respect owed to the divine majesty and of 
love for a faithful God. ( 1237 . 1064 1 

2102 “A vow is a deliberate and free promise made to God concerning a possible and better good 
which must be fulfilled by reason of the virtue of religion, ”21 A vow is an act of devotion in which 
the Christian dedicates himself to God or promises him some good work. By fulfilling his vows he 
renders to God what has been promised and consecrated to Him. The Acts of the Apostles shows us 
St. Paul concerned to fulfill the vows he had made. 22 

2103 The Church recognizes an exemplary value in the vows to practice the evangelical 
counsels ;22 ( 1973 . 914 1 

Mother Church rejoices that she has within herself many men and women who pursue the 
Savior’s self-emptying more closely and show it forth more clearly, by undertaking poverty 
with the freedom of the children of God, and renouncing their own will: they submit 
themselves to man for the sake of God, thus going beyond what is of precept in the matter of 
perfection, so as to conform themselves more fully to the obedient Christ.2d 

The Church can, in certain cases and for proportionate reasons, dispense from vows and 

promises. 22 

The social duty of religion and the right to religious freedom 

2104 “All men are bound to seek the truth, especially in what concerns God and his Church, and to 
embrace it and hold on to it as they come to know it.”2§ This duty derives from “the very dignity of 
the human person.”2Z It does not contradict a “sincere respect” for different religions which 
frequently “reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens all men,”=2 nor the requirement of charity, 
which urges Christians “to treat with love, prudence and patience those who are in error or 
ignorance with regard to the faith. ”22 ( 2467 . 851 ) 

2105 The duty of offering God genuine worship concerns man both individually and socially. This 
is “the traditional Catholic teaching on the moral duty of individuals and societies toward the true 
religion and the one Church of Christ.”22 By constantly evangelizing men, the Church works 
toward enabling them “to infuse the Christian spirit into the mentality and mores, laws and 
structures of the communities in which [they] live. ”21 The social duty of Christians is to respect 
and awaken in each man the love of the true and the good. It requires them to make known the 








worship of the one true religion which subsists in the Catholic and apostolic Church.22 Christians 
are called to be the light of the world. Thus, the Church shows forth the kingship of Christ over all 
creation and in particular over human societies. 22 (854, 898) 

2106 “Nobody may be forced to act against his convictions, nor is anyone to be restrained from 
acting in accordance with his conscience in religious matters in private or in public, alone or in 
association with others, within due limits. ”24 This right is based on the very nature of the human 
person, whose dignity enables him freely to assent to the divine truth which transcends the temporal 
order. For this reason it “continues to exist even in those who do not live up to their obligation of 
seeking the truth and adhering to it. ”22 (160, 1782 . 1738 1 

2107 “If because of the circumstances of a particular people special civil recognition is given to one 
religious community in the constitutional organization of a state, the right of all citizens and 
religious communities to religious freedom must be recognized and respected as well. ”22 

2108 The right to religious liberty is neither a moral license to adhere to error, nor a supposed right 
to error,27 but rather a natural right of the human person to civil liberty, i.e., immunity, within just 
limits, from external constraint in religious matters by political authorities. This natural right ought 
to be acknowledged in the juridical order of society in such a way that it constitutes a civil right. 22 
(1740) 

2109 The right to religious liberty can of itself be neither unlimited nor limited only by a “public 
order” conceived in a positivist or naturalist manner.22 The “due limits” which are inherent in it 
must be determined for each social situation by political prudence, according to the requirements of 
the common good, and ratified by the civil authority in accordance with “legal principles which are 
in conformity with the objective moral order. ”42 (2244, 1906 1 

III. “You Shall Have No Other Gods Before Me” 

2110 The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the one Lord who has revealed 
himself to his people. It proscribes superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents 
a perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to the virtue of religion. 

Superstition 

2111 Superstition is the deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It 
can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some 










way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers 
or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that 
they demand, is to fall into superstition. 41 

Idolatry 

2112 The first commandment condemns polytheism. It requires man neither to believe in, nor to 
venerate, other divinities than the one true God. Scripture constantly recalls this rejection of “idols, 
[of] silver and gold, the work of men’s hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not 
see.” These empty idols make their worshippers empty: “Those who make them are like them; so 
are all who trust in them.”42 God, however, is the “living God”42 who gives life and intervenes in 
history. (210) 

2113 Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a constant temptation to faith. 
Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and 
reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example, satanism), power, 
pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc. Jesus says, “You cannot serve God and 
mammon.”44 Many martyrs died for not adoring “the Beast”^ refusing even to simulate such 
worship. Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore incompatible with communion 
with God.4h (398, 2534, 2289, 2473 1 

2114 Human life finds its unity in the adoration of the one God. The commandment to worship the 
Lord alone integrates man and saves him from an endless disintegration. Idolatry is a perversion of 
man’s innate religious sense. An idolater is someone who “transfers his indestructible notion of 
God to anything other than God.”4Z 

Divination and magic 

2115 God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints. Still, a sound Christian attitude 
consists in putting oneself confidently into the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the 
future, and giving up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvidence, however, can constitute a lack 
of responsibility. (305) 

2116 All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead 
or other practices falsely supposed to “unveil” the future.^ Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm 
reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums 
all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as 








well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and loving fear that 
we owe to God alone. 

2117 All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place 
them at one’s service and have a supernatural power over others—even if this were for the sake of 
restoring their health—are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. These practices are even more 
to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they have 
recourse to the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. Spiritism often 
implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it. 
Recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the 
exploitation of another’s credulity. 

Irreligion 

2118 God’s first commandment condemns the main sins of irreligion: tempting God, in words or 
deeds, sacrilege, and simony. 

2119 Tempting God consists in putting his goodness and almighty power to the test by word or 
deed. Thus Satan tried to induce Jesus to throw himself down from the Temple and, by this gesture, 
force God to act.^ Jesus opposed Satan with the word of God: “You shall not put the LORD your 
God to the test.”^ The challenge contained in such tempting of God wounds the respect and trust 
we owe our Creator and Lord. It always harbors doubt about his love, his providence, and his 
powers (394, 2088 1 

2120 Sacrilege consists in profaning or treating unworthily the sacraments and other liturgical 
actions, as well as persons, things, or places consecrated to God. Sacrilege is a grave sin especially 
when committed against the Eucharist, for in this sacrament the true Body of Christ is made 
substantially present for us.^2 (1374) 

2121 Simony is defined as the buying or selling of spiritual things.^ To Simon the magician, who 
wanted to buy the spiritual power he saw at work in the apostles, St. Peter responded: “Your silver 
perish with you, because you thought you could obtain God’s gift with money !”^4 Peter thus held 
to the words of Jesus: “You received without pay, give without pay . ”^2 It is impossible to 
appropriate to oneself spiritual goods and behave toward them as their owner or master, for they 
have their source in God. One can receive them only from him, without payment. ( 1578 1 


2122 “The minister should ask nothing for the administration of the sacraments beyond the 







offerings defined by the competent authority, always being careful that the needy are not deprived 
of the help of the sacraments because of their poverty.”^ The competent authority determines these 
“offerings” in accordance with the principle that the Christian people ought to contribute to the 
support of the Church’s ministers. “The laborer deserves his food.”^ 

Atheism 

2123 “Many... of our contemporaries either do not at all perceive, or explicitly reject, this intimate 
and vital bond of man to God. Atheism must therefore be regarded as one of the most serious 
problems of our time.”^ (22) 

2124 The name “atheism” covers many very different phenomena. One common form is the 
practical materialism which restricts its needs and aspirations to space and time. Atheistic 
humanism falsely considers man to be “an end to himself, and the sole maker, with supreme 
control, of his own history.”^ Another form of contemporary atheism looks for the liberation of 
man through economic and social liberation. “It holds that religion, of its very nature, thwarts such 
emancipation by raising man’s hopes in a future life, thus both deceiving him and discouraging him 
from working for a better form of life on earth.”^ 

2125 Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin against the virtue of religion.^1 
The imputability of this offense can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the 
circumstances. “Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise of atheism. To the extent 
that they are careless about their instruction in the faith, or present its teaching falsely, or even fail 
in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than to reveal the true 
nature of God and of religion.”h2 (1735) 

2126 Atheism is often based on a false conception of human autonomy, exaggerated to the point of 
refusing any dependence on God.^ Yet, “to acknowledge God is in no way to oppose the dignity 
of man, since such dignity is grounded and brought to perfection in God.. ..”^4 “For the Church 
knows full well that her message is in harmony with the most secret desires of the human heart.”h£ 
(396,154) 

Agnosticism 

2127 Agnosticism assumes a number of forms. In certain cases the agnostic refrains from denying 
God; instead he postulates the existence of a transcendent being which is incapable of revealing 
itself, and about which nothing can be said. In other cases, the agnostic makes no judgment about 





God’s existence, declaring it impossible to prove, or even to affirm or deny. (36) 

2128 Agnosticism can sometimes include a certain search for God, but it can equally express 
indifferentism, a flight from the ultimate question of existence, and a sluggish moral conscience. 
Agnosticism is all too often equivalent to practical atheism. ( 1036 ) 

IV. “You Shall Not Make for Yourself a Graven Image...” 1159-1162 

2129 The divine injunction included the prohibition of every representation of God by the hand of 
man. Deuteronomy explains: “Since you saw no form on the day that the LORD spoke to you at 
Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for 
yourselves, in the form of any figure.... It is the absolutely transcendent God who revealed 
himself to Israel. “He is the all,” but at the same time “he is greater than all his works. He is “the 
author of beauty. (300, 2500 ) 

2130 Nevertheless, already in the Old Testament, God ordained or permitted the making of images 
that pointed symbolically toward salvation by the incarnate Word: so it was with the bronze 
serpent, the ark of the covenant, and the cherubim.hS 

2131 Basing itself on the mystery of the incarnate Word, the seventh ecumenical council at Nicaea 
(787) justified against the iconoclasts the veneration of icons—of Christ, but also of the Mother of 
God, the angels, and all the saints. By becoming incarnate, the Son of God introduced a new 
“economy” of images. (476) 

2132 The Christian veneration of images is not contrary to the first commandment which proscribes 
idols. Indeed, “the honor rendered to an image passes to its prototype,” and “whoever venerates an 
image venerates the person portrayed in it.” ^ The honor paid to sacred images is a “respectful 
veneration,” not the adoration due to God alone: 

Religious worship is not directed to images in themselves, considered as mere things, but 
under their distinctive aspect as images leading us on to God incarnate. The movement toward 
the image does not terminate in it as image, but tends toward that whose image it is.^1 


IN BRIEF 


2133 “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all 









your strength” (Deut 6:5). 


2134 The first commandment summons man to believe in God, to hope in him, and to love him 
above all else. 

2135 “You shall worship the Lord your God” (Mt 4:10). Adoring God, praying to him, offering him 
the worship that belongs to him, fulfilling the promises and vows made to him are acts of the virtue 
of religion which fall under obedience to the first commandment. 

2136 The duty to offer God authentic worship concerns man both as an individual and as a social 
being. 

2137 “Men of the present day want to profess their religion freely in private and in public” (DH 
15). 

2138 Superstition is a departure from the worship that we give to the true God. It is manifested in 
idolatry, as well as in various forms of divination and magic. 

2139 Tempting God in words or deeds, sacrilege, and simony are sins of irreligion forbidden by the 
first commandment. 

2140 Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin against the first 
commandment. 

2141 The veneration of sacred images is based on the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word of 
God. It is not contrary to the first commandment. 


ARTICLE 2 

THE SECOND COMMANDMENT 


You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.^2 

You have heard that it was said to the men of old, “You shall not swear falsely....” But I say to 
you, Do not swear at all .^2 

I. The Name of the Lord Is Holy 2807-2815 










2142 The second commandment prescribes respect for the Lord’s name. Like the first 
commandment, it belongs to the virtue of religion and more particularly it governs our use of 
speech in sacred matters. 

2143 Among all the words of Revelation, there is one which is unique: the revealed name of God. 
God confides his name to those who believe in him; he reveals himself to them in his personal 
mystery. The gift of a name belongs to the order of trust and intimacy. “The Lord’s name is holy.” 
For this reason man must not abuse it. He must keep it in mind in silent, loving adoration. He will 
not introduce it into his own speech except to bless, praise, and glorify it.^ (203, 435) 

2144 Respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed to the mystery of God himself and 
to the whole sacred reality it evokes. The sense of the sacred is part of the virtue of religion: 

Are these feelings of fear and awe Christian feelings or not?... I say this, then, which I think no 
one can reasonably dispute. They are the class of feelings we should have—yes, have to an 
intense degree—if we literally had the sight of Almighty God; therefore they are the class of 
feelings which we shall have, if we realize His presence. In proportion as we believe that He is 
present, we shall have them; and not to have them, is not to realize, not to believe that He is 
present.^ 

2145 The faithful should bear witness to the Lord’s name by confessing the faith without giving 
way to fear.^S Preaching and catechizing should be permeated with adoration and respect for the 
name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ( 2472 . 427) 

2146 The second commandment forbids the abuse of God’s name, i.e., every improper use of the 
names of God, Jesus Christ, but also of the Virgin Mary and all the saints. 

2147 Promises made to others in God’s name engage the divine honor, fidelity, truthfulness, and 
authority. They must be respected in justice. To be unfaithful to them is to misuse God’s name and 
in some way to make God out to be a liar.^7 ( 2101 ) 

2148 Blasphemy is directly opposed to the second commandment. It consists in uttering against 
God—inwardly or outwardly—words of hatred, reproach, or defiance; in speaking ill of God; in 
failing in respect toward him in one’s speech; in misusing God’s name. St. James condemns those 
“who blaspheme that honorable name [of Jesus] by which you are called.”^ The prohibition of 
blasphemy extends to language against Christ’s Church, the saints, and sacred things. It is also 
blasphemous to make use of God’s name to cover up criminal practices, to reduce peoples to 









servitude, to torture persons or put them to death. The misuse of God’s name to commit a crime can 
provoke others to repudiate religion. (1756) 

Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due God and his holy name. It is in itself a grave sin.^2 

2149 Oaths which misuse God’s name, though without the intention of blasphemy, show lack of 
respect for the Lord. The second commandment also forbids magical use of the divine name. 

[God’s] name is great when spoken with respect for the greatness of his majesty. God’s name 
is holy when said with veneration and fear of offending him.SO 

II. Taking the Name of the Lord in Vain 

2150 The second commandment forbids false oaths. Taking an oath or swearing is to take God as 
witness to what one affirms. It is to invoke the divine truthfulness as a pledge of one’s own 
truthfulness. An oath engages the Lord’s name. “You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall 
serve him, and swear by his name.”^l 

2151 Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator and Lord, God is the norm of all 
truth. Human speech is either in accord with or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is 
truthful and legitimate, an oath highlights the relationship of human speech with God’s truth. A 
false oath calls on God to be witness to a lie. ( 215 1 

2152 A person commits perjury when he makes a promise under oath with no intention of keeping 
it, or when after promising on oath he does not keep it. Perjury is a grave lack of respect for the 
Lord of all speech. Pledging oneself by oath to commit an evil deed is contrary to the holiness of 
the divine name. ( 2476 . 1756 1 

2153 In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second commandment: “You have heard 
that it was said to the men of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what 
you have sworn.’ But I say to you, Do not swear at all.... Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; 
anything more than this comes from the evil one.”^2 Jesus teaches that every oath involves a 
reference to God and that God’s presence and his truth must be honored in all speech. Discretion in 
calling upon God is allied with a respectful awareness of his presence, which all our assertions 
either witness to or mock. ( 2466 1 

2154 Following St. Paul, the tradition of the Church has understood Jesus’ words as not 
excluding oaths made for grave and right reasons (for example, in court). “An oath, that is the 







invocation of the divine name as a witness to truth, cannot be taken unless in truth, in judgment, 
and in justice.”^ 

2155 The holiness of the divine name demands that we neither use it for trivial matters, nor take an 
oath which on the basis of the circumstances could be interpreted as approval of an authority 
unjustly requiring it. When an oath is required by illegitimate civil authorities, it may be refused. It 
must be refused when it is required for purposes contrary to the dignity of persons or to ecclesial 
communion. ( 1903 1 

III. The Christian Name 

2156 The sacrament of Baptism is conferred “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Spirit.”^ In Baptism, the Lord’s name sanctifies man, and the Christian receives his name in 
the Church. This can be the name of a saint, that is, of a disciple who has lived a life of exemplary 
fidelity to the Lord. The patron saint provides a model of charity; we are assured of his 
intercession. The “baptismal name” can also express a Christian mystery or Christian virtue. 
“Parents, sponsors, and the pastor are to see that a name is not given which is foreign to Christian 
sentiment.”^ (232, 1267 1 

2157 The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities with the Sign of the Cross: “in the 
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.” The baptized person dedicates the 
day to the glory of God and calls on the Savior’s grace which lets him act in the Spirit as a child of 
the Father. The sign of the cross strengthens us in temptations and difficulties. 1 1235 . 1668 1 

2158 God calls each one by name.^ Everyone’s name is sacred. The name is the icon of the 
person. It demands respect as a sign of the dignity of the one who bears it. 

2159 The name one receives is a name for eternity. In the kingdom, the mysterious and unique 
character of each person marked with God’s name will shine forth in splendor. “To him who 
conquers... I will give a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one knows 
except him who receives it.”^ “Then I looked, and Lo, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with 
him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father’s name written on their 

foreheads.”^ 


IN BRIEF 









2160 “O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth” (Ps 8:1)! 


2161 The second commandment enjoins respect for the Lord’s name. The name of the Lord is holy. 

2162 The second commandment forbids every improper use of God’s name. Blasphemy is the use 
of the name of God, of Jesus Christ, of the Virgin Mary, and of the saints in an offensive way. 

2163 False oaths call on God to be witness to a lie. Perjury is a grave offence against the Lord who 
is always faithful to his promises. 

2164 “Do not swear whether by the Creator, or any creature, except truthfully, of necessity, and 
with reverence” (St. Ignatius of Loyola, Spiritual Exercises, 38). 

2165 In Baptism, the Christian receives his name in the Church. Parents, godparents, and the pastor 
are to see that he be given a Christian name. The patron saint provides a model of charity and the 
assurance of his prayer. 

2166 The Christian begins his prayers and activities with the Sign of the Cross: “in the name of the 
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.” 

2167 God calls each one by name (cf. Isa 43:1). 


ARTICLE 3 

THE THIRD COMMANDMENT 


Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work; but 
the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work.2Q 

The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath; so the Son of Man is lord even of the 
sabbath .21 

I. The Sabbath Day 346-348 

2168 The third commandment of the Decalogue recalls the holiness of the sabbath: “The seventh 
day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. ”22 


2169 In speaking of the sabbath Scripture recalls creation: “For in six days the LORD made heaven 







and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed 
the sabbath day and hallowed it. ”23 (2057) 


2170 Scripture also reveals in the Lord’s day a memorial of Israel’s liberation from bondage in 
Egypt: “You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God 
brought you out thence with mighty hand and outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God 
commanded you to keep the sabbath day. ”24 

2171 God entrusted the sabbath to Israel to keep as a sign of the irrevocable covenant .22 The 
sabbath is for the Lord, holy and set apart for the praise of God, his work of creation, and his saving 
actions on behalf of Israel. 

2172 God’s action is the model for human action. If God “rested and was refreshed” on the seventh 
day, man too ought to “rest” and should let others, especially the poor, “be refreshed.”22 The 
sabbath brings everyday work to a halt and provides a respite. It is a day of protest against the 
servitude of work and the worship of money.27 (2184) 

2173 The Gospel reports many incidents when Jesus was accused of violating the sabbath law. But 
Jesus never fails to respect the holiness of this day.22 He gives this law its authentic and 
authoritative interpretation: “The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.”22 With 
compassion, Christ declares the sabbath for doing good rather than harm, for saving life rather than 
killing.122 The sabbath is the day of the Lord of mercies and a day to honor God.121 “The Son of 
Man is lord even of the sabbath. ”122 (582) 

II. The Lord’s Day 

This is the day which the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it. 122 
The day of the Resurrection: the new creation 

2174 Jesus rose from the dead “on the first day of the week.”124 Because it is the “first day,” the 
day of Christ’s Resurrection recalls the first creation. Because it is the “eighth day” following the 
sabbath, 122 it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ’s Resurrection. For Christians it has 
become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the Lord’s Day (he kuriake hemera, dies 
dominica) —Sunday: (638, 349) 


We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the Jewish sabbath, but also the 







first day] when God, separating matter from darkness, made the world; and on this same day 
Jesus Christ our Savior rose from the dead.122 

Sunday—fulfillment of the sabbath 

2175 Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which it follows chronologically every 
week; for Christians its ceremonial observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ’s Passover, 
Sunday fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man’s eternal rest in God. 
For worship under the Law prepared for the mystery of Christ, and what was done there prefigured 
some aspects of Christ:^ (1166) 

Those who lived according to the old order of things have come to a new hope, no longer 
keeping the sabbath, but the Lord’s Day, in which our life is blessed by him and by his 

death .122 


2176 The celebration of Sunday observes the moral commandment inscribed by nature in the 
human heart to render to God an outward, visible, public, and regular worship “as a sign of his 
universal beneficence to all. ”122 Sunday worship fulfills the moral command of the Old Covenant, 
taking up its rhythm and spirit in the weekly celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people. 

The Sunday Eucharist 

2177 The Sunday celebration of the Lord’s Day and his Eucharist is at the heart of the Church’s 
life. “Sunday is the day on which the paschal mystery is celebrated in light of the apostolic tradition 
and is to be observed as the foremost holy day of obligation in the universal Church.”H2 ( 1167 . 
2043 1 

“Also to be observed are the day of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Epiphany, the 
Ascension of Christ, the feast of the Body and Blood of Christi, the feast of Mary the Mother of 
God, her Immaculate Conception, her Assumption, the feast of Saint Joseph, the feast of the 
Apostles Saints Peter and Paul, and the feast of All Saints. 

2178 This practice of the Christian assembly dates from the beginnings of the apostolic age.112 The 
Letter to the Hebrews reminds the faithful “not to neglect to meet together, as is the habit of some, 
but to encourage one another.”H2 ( 1343 1 


Tradition preserves the memory of an ever-timely exhortation: Come to Church early, 
approach the Lord, and confess your sins, repent in prayer.... Be present at the sacred and 






divine liturgy, conclude its prayer and do not leave before the dismissal.... We have often said: 
“This day is given to you for prayer and rest. This is the day that the Lord has made, let us 
rejoice and be glad in it.”l±4 

2179 “A parish is a definite community of the Christian faithful established on a stable basis within 
a particular church; the pastoral care of the parish is entrusted to a pastor as its own shepherd under 
the authority of the diocesan bishop. ”H5 it i s the place where ah the faithful can be gathered 
together for the Sunday celebration of the Eucharist. The parish initiates the Christian people into 
the ordinary expression of the liturgical life: it gathers them together in this celebration; it teaches 
Christ’s saving doctrine; it practices the charity of the Lord in good works and brotherly love: 
( 1567 . 2691 . 2226) 

You cannot pray at home as at church, where there is a great multitude, where exclamations 
are cried out to God as from one great heart, and where there is something more: the union of 
minds, the accord of souls, the bond of charity, the prayers of the priests.^ 

The Sunday obligation 

2180 The precept of the Church specifies the law of the Lord more precisely: “On Sundays and 
other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to participate in the Mass.”i±2 “The precept of 
participating in the Mass is satisfied by assistance at a Mass which is celebrated anywhere in a 
Catholic rite either on the holy day or on the evening of the preceding day.”H8 (2042 . 1389 1 

2181 The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of all Christian practice. For this 
reason the faithful are obliged to participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, unless excused 
for a serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by their own pastor.l^ 
Those who deliberately fail in this obligation commit a grave sin. 

2182 Participation in the communal celebration of the Sunday Eucharist is a testimony of belonging 
and of being faithful to Christ and to his Church. The faithful give witness by this to their 
communion in faith and charity. Together they testify to God’s holiness and their hope of salvation. 
They strengthen one another under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. ( 815 1 

2183 “If because of lack of a sacred minister or for other grave cause participation in the 
celebration of the Eucharist is impossible, it is specially recommended that the faithful take part in 
the Liturgy of the Word if it is celebrated in the parish church or in another sacred place according 
to the prescriptions of the diocesan bishop, or engage in prayer for an appropriate amount of time 








personally or in a family or, as occasion offers, in groups of families.”!^ 

A day of grace and rest from work 

2184 Just as God “rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done,”l^i human life 
has a rhythm of work and rest. The institution of the Lord’s Day helps everyone enjoy adequate rest 
and leisure to cultivate their familial, cultural, social, and religious lives.122 ( 2172 ) 

2185 On Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are to refrain from engaging in 
work or activities that hinder the worship owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord’s Day, the 
performance of the works of mercy, and the appropriate relaxation of mind and body.— Family 
needs or important social service can legitimately excuse from the obligation of Sunday rest. The 
faithful should see to it that legitimate excuses do not lead to habits prejudicial to religion, family 
life, and health. (2428) 

The charity of truth seeks holy leisure; the necessity of charity accepts just work.l^ 

2186 Those Christians who have leisure should be mindful of their brethren who have the same 
needs and the same rights, yet cannot rest from work because of poverty and misery. Sunday is 
traditionally consecrated by Christian piety to good works and humble service of the sick, the 
infirm, and the elderly. Christians will also sanctify Sunday by devoting time and care to their 
families and relatives, often difficult to do on other days of the week. Sunday is a time for 
reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which furthers the growth of the 
Christian interior life. ( 2447 1 

2187 Sanctifying Sundays and holy days requires a common effort. Every Christian should avoid 
making unnecessary demands on others that would hinder them from observing the Lord’s Day. 
Traditional activities (sport, restaurants, etc.), and social necessities (public services, etc.), require 
some people to work on Sundays, but everyone should still take care to set aside sufficient time for 
leisure. With temperance and charity the faithful will see to it that they avoid the excesses and 
violence sometimes associated with popular leisure activities. In spite of economic constraints, 
public authorities should ensure citizens a time intended for rest and divine worship. Employers 
have a similar obligation toward their employees. (2289) 

2188 In respecting religious liberty and the common good of all, Christians should seek recognition 
of Sundays and the Church’s holy days as legal holidays. They have to give everyone a public 
example of prayer, respect, and joy and defend their traditions as a precious contribution to the 
spiritual life of society. If a country’s legislation or other reasons require work on Sunday, the day 






should nevertheless be lived as the day of our deliverance which lets us share in this “festal 
gathering,” this “assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven. ”1^ 1 2105 1 


IN BRIEF 

2189 “Observe the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Deut 5:12). “The seventh day is a sabbath of 
solemn rest, holy to the Lord” (Ex 31:15). 

2190 The sabbath, which represented the completion of the first creation, has been replaced by 
Sunday which recalls the new creation inaugurated by the Resurrection of Christ. 

2191 The Church celebrates the day of Christ’s Resurrection on the “eighth day,” Sunday, which is 
rightly called the Lord’s Day (cf. SC 106). 

2192 “Sunday... is to be observed as the foremost holy day of obligation in the universal Church” 
(CIC, can. 1246 § 1). “On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to 
participate in the Mass” (CIC, can. 1247). 

2193 “On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound... to abstain from those 
labors and business concerns which impede the worship to be rendered to God, the joy which is 
proper to the Lord’s Day, or the proper relaxation of mind and body” (CIC, can. 1247). 

2194 The institution of Sunday helps all “to be allowed sufficient rest and leisure to cultivate their 
familial, cultural, social, and religious lives” (GS 67 § 3). 

2195 Every Christian should avoid making unnecessary demands on others that would hinder them 
from observing the Lord’s Day.

CHAPTER TWO 

“YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF” 


Jesus said to his disciples: “Love one another even as I have loved you.”- 

2196 In response to the question about the first of the commandments, Jesus says: “The first is, 
'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all 
your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ The second 
is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than 
these. (2822) 

The apostle St. Paul reminds us of this: “He who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. The 
commandments, ‘You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall 
not covet,’ and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence, ‘You shall love your 
neighbor as yourself.’ Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the 
law.”3 


ARTICLE 4 

THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT 


Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord 
your God gives you.4 

He was obedient to them.^ 

The Lord Jesus himself recalled the force of this “commandment of God.”§ The Apostle 
teaches: “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. ‘Honor your father and 
mother,’ (This is the first commandment with a promise.) ‘that it may be well with you and 
that you may live long on the earth. ”’Z 

2197 The fourth commandment opens the second table of the Decalogue. It shows us the order of 
charity. God has willed that, after him, we should honor our parents to whom we owe life and who 
have handed on to us the knowledge of God. We are obliged to honor and respect all those whom 
God, for our good, has vested with his authority. 1 1897 1 


2198 This commandment is expressed in positive terms of duties to be fulfilled. It introduces the 








subsequent commandments which are concerned with particular respect for life, marriage, earthly 
goods, and speech. It constitutes one of the foundations of the social doctrine of the Church. (2419) 

2199 The fourth commandment is addressed expressly to children in their relationship to their 
father and mother, because this relationship is the most universal. It likewise concerns the ties of 
kinship between members of the extended family. It requires honor, affection, and gratitude toward 
elders and ancestors. Finally, it extends to the duties of pupils to teachers, employees to employers, 
subordinates to leaders, citizens to their country, and to those who administer or govern it. 

This commandment includes and presupposes the duties of parents, instructors, teachers, 
leaders, magistrates, those who govern, all who exercise authority over others or over a community 
of persons. 

2200 Observing the fourth commandment brings its reward: “Honor your father and your mother, 
that your days may be long in the land which the LORD your God gives you.”^ Respecting this 
commandment provides, along with spiritual fruits, temporal fruits of peace and prosperity. 
Conversely, failure to observe it brings great harm to communities and to individuals. (2304) 

I. The Family in God’s Plan 

The nature of the family 

2201 The conjugal community is established upon the consent of the spouses. Marriage and the 
family are ordered to the good of the spouses and to the procreation and education of children. The 
love of the spouses and the begetting of children create among members of the same family 
personal relationships and primordial responsibilities. (1625) 

2202 A man and a woman united in marriage, together with their children, form a family. This 
institution is prior to any recognition by public authority, which has an obligation to recognize it. It 
should be considered the normal reference point by which the different forms of family relationship 
are to be evaluated. 1 1882 1 

2203 In creating man and woman, God instituted the human family and endowed it with its 
fundamental constitution. Its members are persons equal in dignity. For the common good of its 
members and of society, the family necessarily has manifold responsibilities, rights, and duties. 
(369) 


The Christian family 1655-1658 








2204 “The Christian family constitutes a specific revelation and realization of ecclesial 
communion, and for this reason it can and should be called a domestic church .”2 It is a community 
of faith, hope, and charity; it assumes singular importance in the Church, as is evident in the New 
Testament.!^ (533) 

2205 The Christian family is a communion of persons, a sign and image of the communion of the 
Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit. In the procreation and education of children it reflects the 
Father’s work of creation. It is called to partake of the prayer and sacrifice of Christ. Daily prayer 
and the reading of the Word of God strengthen it in charity. The Christian family has an 
evangelizing and missionary task. (1702) 

2206 The relationships within the family bring an affinity of feelings, affections and interests, 
arising above all from the members’ respect for one another. The family is a privileged community 
called to achieve a “sharing of thought and common deliberation by the spouses as well as their 
eager cooperation as parents in the children’s upbringing.’’^ 

II. The Family and Society 

2207 The family is the original cell of social life. It is the natural society in which husband and 
wife are called to give themselves in love and in the gift of life. Authority, stability, and a life of 
relationships within the family constitute the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity 
within society. The family is the community in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values, 
begin to honor God, and make good use of freedom. Family life is an initiation into life in society. 
1 1880 . 372 . 1603 1 

2208 The family should live in such a way that its members learn to care and take responsibility for 
the young, the old, the sick, the handicapped, and the poor. There are many families who are at 
times incapable of providing this help. It devolves then on other persons, other families, and, in a 
subsidiary way, society to provide for their needs: “Religion that is pure and undefiled before God 
and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained 
from the world. 

2209 The family must be helped and defended by appropriate social measures. Where families 
cannot fulfill their responsibilities, other social bodies have the duty of helping them and of 
supporting the institution of the family. Following the principle of subsidiarity, larger communities 
should take care not to usurp the family’s prerogatives or interfere in its life. (1883) 








2210 The importance of the family for the life and well-being of society^ entails a particular 
responsibility for society to support and strengthen marriage and the family. Civil authority should 
consider it a grave duty “to acknowledge the true nature of marriage and the family, to protect and 
foster them, to safeguard public morality, and promote domestic prosperity.”^ 

2211 The political community has a duty to honor the family, to assist it, and to ensure especially: 

-the freedom to establish a family, have children, and bring them up in keeping with the 
family’s own moral and religious convictions; 

-the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution of the family; 

-the freedom to profess one’s faith, to hand it on, and raise one’s children in it, with the 
necessary means and institutions; 

-the right to private property, to free enterprise, to obtain work and housing, and the right to 
emigrate; 

-in keeping with the country’s institutions, the right to medical care, assistance for the aged, 
and family benefits; 

-the protection of security and health, especially with respect to dangers like drugs, 
pornography, alcoholism, etc.; 

-the freedom to form associations with other families and so to have representation before civil 
authority.!^ 

2212 The fourth commandment illuminates other relationships in society. In our brothers and 
sisters we see the children of our parents; in our cousins, the descendants of our ancestors; in our 
fellow citizens, the children of our country; in the baptized, the children of our mother the Church; 
in every human person, a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called “our Father.” In this 
way our relationships with our neighbors are recognized as personal in character. The neighbor is 
not a “unit” in the human collective; he is “someone” who by his known origins deserves particular 
attention and respect. (225, 1931 1 

2213 Human communities are made up of persons. Governing them well is not limited to 
guaranteeing rights and fulfilling duties such as honoring contracts. Right relations between 
employers and employees, between those who govern and citizens, presuppose a natural good will 
in keeping with the dignity of human persons concerned for justice and fraternity. 1 1939 1 


III. The Duties of Family Members 





The duties of children 


2214 The divine fatherhood is the source of human fatherhood;^? this is the foundation of the honor 
owed to parents. The respect of children, whether minors or adults, for their father and mother^ is 
nourished by the natural affection born of the bond uniting them. It is required by God’s 
commandment.^ (1858) 

2215 Respect for parents (filial piety ) derives from gratitude toward those who, by the gift of life, 
their love and their work, have brought their children into the world and enabled them to grow in 
stature, wisdom, and grace. “With all your heart honor your father, and do not forget the birth 
pangs of your mother. Remember that through your parents you were born; what can you give back 
to them that equals their gift to you?”19 

2216 Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. “My son, keep your father’s 
commandment, and forsake not your mother’s teaching.... When you walk, they will lead you; 
when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.”22 “A 
wise son hears his father’s instruction, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.”^ (532) 

2217 As long as a child lives at home with his parents, the child should obey his parents in all that 
they ask of him when it is for his good or that of the family. “Children, obey your parents in 
everything, for this pleases the Lord.”^ Children should also obey the reasonable directions of 
their teachers and all to whom their parents have entrusted them. But if a child is convinced in 
conscience that it would be morally wrong to obey a particular order, he must not do so. ( 1831 1 

As they grow up, children should continue to respect their parents. They should anticipate 
their wishes, willingly seek their advice, and accept their just admonitions. Obedience toward 
parents ceases with the emancipation of the children; not so respect, which is always owed to them. 
This respect has its roots in the fear of God, one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. 

2218 The fourth commandment reminds grown children of their responsibilities toward their 
parents. As much as they can, they must give them material and moral support in old age and in 
times of illness, loneliness, or distress. Jesus recalls this duty of gratitude.23 

For the Lord honored the father above the children, and he confirmed the right of the mother 
over her sons. Whoever honors his father atones for sins, and whoever glorifies his mother is 
like one who lays up treasure. Whoever honors his father will be gladdened by his own 
children, and when he prays he will be heard. Whoever glorifies his father will have long life, 
and whoever obeys the Lord will refresh his mother.24 





O son, help your father in his old age, and do not grieve him as long as he lives; even if he is 
lacking in understanding, show forbearance; in all your strength do not despise him.... 
Whoever forsakes his father is like a blasphemer, and whoever angers his mother is cursed by 
the Lord.^2 

2219 Filial respect promotes harmony in all of family life; it also concerns relationships between 
brothers and sisters. Respect toward parents fills the home with light and warmth. “Grandchildren 
are the crown of the aged.”22 “With all humility and meekness, with patience, [support] one 
another in charity. ”2? 

2220 For Christians a special gratitude is due to those from whom they have received the gift of 
faith, the grace of Baptism, and life in the Church. These may include parents, grandparents, other 
members of the family, pastors, catechists, and other teachers or friends. “I am reminded of your 
sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I 
am sure, dwells in you.”22 

The duties of parents 

2221 The fecundity of conjugal love cannot be reduced solely to the procreation of children, but 
must extend to their moral education and their spiritual formation. “The role of parents in 
education is of such importance that it is almost impossible to provide an adequate substitute.”^ 
The right and the duty of parents to educate their children are primordial and inalienable. 22 ( 1653 1 

2222 Parents must regard their children as children of God and respect them as human persons. 
Showing themselves obedient to the will of the Father in heaven, they educate their children to 
fulfill God’s law. ( 494 1 

2223 Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their children. They bear witness to 
this responsibility first by creating a home where tenderness, forgiveness, respect, fidelity, and 
disinterested service are the rule. The home is well suited for education in the virtues. This requires 
an apprenticeship in self-denial, sound judgment, and self-mastery—the preconditions of all true 
freedom. Parents should teach their children to subordinate the “material and instinctual dimensions 
to interior and spiritual ones. ”21 Parents have a grave responsibility to give good example to their 
children. By knowing how to acknowledge their own failings to their children, parents will be 
better able to guide and correct them: ( 1804 1 


He who loves his son will not spare the rod.... He who disciplines his son will profit by him.22 





Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and 
instruction of the Lord.22 

2224 The home is the natural environment for initiating a human being into solidarity and 
communal responsibilities. Parents should teach children to avoid the compromising and degrading 
influences which threaten human societies. (1939) 

2225 Through the grace of the sacrament of marriage, parents receive the responsibility and 
privilege of evangelizing their children. Parents should initiate their children at an early age into the 
mysteries of the faith of which they are the “first heralds” for their children. They should associate 
them from their tenderest years with the life of the Church.^! A wholesome family life can foster 
interior dispositions that are a genuine preparation for a living faith and remain a support for it 
throughout one’s life. ( 1656 1 

2226 Education in the faith by the parents should begin in the child’s earliest years. This already 
happens when family members help one another to grow in faith by the witness of a Christian life 
in keeping with the Gospel. Family catechesis precedes, accompanies, and enriches other forms of 
instruction in the faith. Parents have the mission of teaching their children to pray and to discover 
their vocation as children of God.^ The parish is the Eucharistic community and the heart of the 
liturgical life of Christian families; it is a privileged place for the catechesis of children and parents. 
(2179) 

2227 Children in turn contribute to the growth in holiness of their parents.^ Each and everyone 
should be generous and tireless in forgiving one another for offenses, quarrels, injustices, and 
neglect. Mutual affection suggests this. The charity of Christ demands itM (2013) 

2228 Parents’ respect and affection are expressed by the care and attention they devote to bringing 
up their young children and providing for their physical and spiritual needs. As the children grow 
up, the same respect and devotion lead parents to educate them in the right use of their reason and 
freedom. 

2229 As those first responsible for the education of their children, parents have the right to choose 
a school for them which corresponds to their own convictions. This right is fundamental. As far as 
possible parents have the duty of choosing schools that will best help them in their task as Christian 
educators.^ Public authorities have the duty of guaranteeing this parental right and of ensuring the 
concrete conditions for its exercise. 






2230 When they become adults, children have the right and duty to choose their profession and 
state of life. They should assume their new responsibilities within a trusting relationship with their 
parents, willingly asking and receiving their advice and counsel. Parents should be careful not to 
exert pressure on their children either in the choice of a profession or in that of a spouse. This 
necessary restraint does not prevent them—quite the contrary—from giving their children judicious 
advice, particularly when they are planning to start a family. (1625) 

2231 Some forgo marriage in order to care for their parents or brothers and sisters, to give 
themselves more completely to a profession, or to serve other honorable ends. They can contribute 
greatly to the good of the human family. 

IV. The Family and the Kingdom 

2232 Family ties are important but not absolute. Just as the child grows to maturity and human and 
spiritual autonomy, so his unique vocation which comes from God asserts itself more clearly and 
forcefully. Parents should respect this call and encourage their children to follow it. They must be 
convinced that the first vocation of the Christian is to follow Jesus: “He who loves father or mother 
more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of 
me.”29 (1618) 

2233 Becoming a disciple of Jesus means accepting the invitation to belong to God’s family, to live 
in conformity with His way of life: “For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my 
brother, and sister, and mother.”!^ (542) 

Parents should welcome and respect with joy and thanksgiving the Lord’s call to one of their 
children to follow him in virginity for the sake of the Kingdom in the consecrated life or in priestly 
ministry. 

V. The Authorities in Civil Society 

2234 God’s fourth commandment also enjoins us to honor all who for our good have received 
authority in society from God. It clarifies the duties of those who exercise authority as well as those 
who benefit from it. ( 1897 ) 

Duties of civil authorities 

2235 Those who exercise authority should do so as a service. “Whoever would be great among you 
must be your servant.”!! The exercise of authority is measured morally in terms of its divine origin, 






its reasonable nature and its specific object. No one can command or establish what is contrary to 
the dignity of persons and the natural law. (1899 ) 

2236 The exercise of authority is meant to give outward expression to a just hierarchy of values in 
order to facilitate the exercise of freedom and responsibility by ah. Those in authority should 
practice distributive justice wisely, taking account of the needs and contribution of each, with a 
view to harmony and peace. They should take care that the regulations and measures they adopt are 
not a source of temptation by setting personal interest against that of the community.^ ( 2411 ) 

2237 Political authorities are obliged to respect the fundamental rights of the human person. They 
will dispense justice humanely by respecting the rights of everyone, especially of families and the 
disadvantaged. (357) 

The political rights attached to citizenship can and should be granted according to the 
requirements of the common good. They cannot be suspended by public authorities without 
legitimate and proportionate reasons. Political rights are meant to be exercised for the common 
good of the nation and the human community. 

The duties of citizens 

2238 Those subject to authority should regard those in authority as representatives of God, who has 
made them stewards of his gifts:^ “Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution.... 
Live as free men, yet without using your freedom as a pretext for evil; but live as servants of 
God.”44 Their loyal collaboration includes the right, and at times the duty, to voice their just 
criticisms of that which seems harmful to the dignity of persons and to the good of the community. 

( 1900 ) 

2239 It is the duty of citizens to contribute along with the civil authorities to the good of society in a 
spirit of truth, justice, solidarity, and freedom. The love and service of one’s country follow from 
the duty of gratitude and belong to the order of charity. Submission to legitimate authorities and 
service of the common good require citizens to fulfill their roles in the life of the political 
community. ( 1915 . 2310 i 

2240 Submission to authority and co-responsibility for the common good make it morally 
obligatory to pay taxes, to exercise the right to vote, and to defend one’s country: ( 2265 .1900) 

Pay to ah of them their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, 
respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.45 










[Christians] reside in their own nations, but as resident aliens. They participate in all things as 
citizens and endure all things as foreigners.... They obey the established laws and their way of 
life surpasses the laws.... So noble is the position to which God has assigned them that they are 
not allowed to desert it.4§ 

The Apostle exhorts us to offer prayers and thanksgiving for kings and all who exercise 
authority, “that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. ”4^ 

2241 The more prosperous nations are obliged, to the extent they are able, to welcome the foreigner 
in search of the security and the means of livelihood which he cannot find in his country of origin. 
Public authorities should see to it that the natural right is respected that places a guest under the 
protection of those who receive him. 

Political authorities, for the sake of the common good for which they are responsible, may 
make the exercise of the right to immigrate subject to various juridical conditions, especially with 
regard to the immigrants’ duties toward their country of adoption. Immigrants are obliged to 
respect with gratitude the material and spiritual heritage of the country that receives them, to obey 
its laws and to assist in carrying civic burdens. 

2242 The citizen is obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of civil authorities when they 
are contrary to the demands of the moral order, to the fundamental rights of persons or the 
teachings of the Gospel. Refusing obedience to civil authorities, when their demands are contrary to 
those of an upright conscience, finds its justification in the distinction between serving God and 
serving the political community. “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to 
God the things that are God’s. ”42 “We must obey God rather than men”;49 ( 1903 . 2313 . 450 . 1901 1 

When citizens are under the oppression of a public authority which oversteps its competence, 
they should still not refuse to give or to do what is objectively demanded of them by the 
common good; but it is legitimate for them to defend their own rights and those of their fellow 
citizens against the abuse of this authority within the limits of the natural law and the Law of 

the Gospel.^ 

2243 Armed resistance to oppression by political authority is not legitimate, unless all the 
following conditions are met: 1) there is certain, grave, and prolonged violation of fundamental 
rights; 2) all other means of redress have been exhausted; 3) such resistance will not provoke worse 
disorders; 4) there is well-founded hope of success; and 5) it is impossible reasonably to foresee 
any better solution. (2309) 







The political community and the Church 


2244 Every institution is inspired, at least implicitly, by a vision of man and his destiny, from 
which it derives the point of reference for its judgment, its hierarchy of values, its line of conduct. 
Most societies have formed their institutions in the recognition of a certain preeminence of man 
over things. Only the divinely revealed religion has clearly recognized man’s origin and destiny in 
God, the Creator and Redeemer. The Church invites political authorities to measure their judgments 
and decisions against this inspired truth about God and man: ( 1910 . 1881 . 2109 1 

Societies not recognizing this vision or rejecting it in the name of their independence from 
God are brought to seek their criteria and goal in themselves or to borrow them from some 
ideology. Since they do not admit that one can defend an objective criterion of good and evil, 
they arrogate to themselves an explicit or implicit totalitarian power over man and his destiny, 
as history shows.^ 

2245 The Church, because of her commission and competence, is not to be confused in any way 
with the political community. She is both the sign and the safeguard of the transcendent character 
of the human person. “The Church respects and encourages the political freedom and responsibility 
of the citizen.”^ (912) 

2246 It is a part of the Church’s mission “to pass moral judgments even in matters related to 
politics, whenever the fundamental rights of man or the salvation of souls requires it. The means, 
the only means, she may use are those which are in accord with the Gospel and the welfare of all 
men according to the diversity of times and circumstances.”^ (2032, 2420 1 


IN BRIEF 

2247 “Honor your father and your mother” (Deut 5:16; Mk 7:10). 

2248 According to the fourth commandment, God has willed that, after him, we should honor our 
parents and those whom he has vested with authority for our good. 

2249 The conjugal community is established upon the covenant and consent of the spouses. 
Marriage and family are ordered to the good of the spouses, to the procreation and the education of 
children. 










2250 “The well-being of the individual person and of both human and Christian society is closely 
bound up with the healthy state of conjugal and family life” (GS 47 § 1). 

2251 Children owe their parents respect, gratitude, just obedience, and assistance. Filial respect 
fosters harmony in all of family life. 

2252 Parents have the first responsibility for the education of their children in the faith, prayer, and 
all the virtues. They have the duty to provide as far as possible for the physical and spiritual needs 
of their children. 

2253 Parents should respect and encourage their children’s vocations. They should remember and 
teach that the first calling of the Christian is to follow Jesus. 

2254 Public authority is obliged to respect the fundamental rights of the human person and the 
conditions for the exercise of his freedom. 

2255 It is the duty of citizens to work with civil authority for building up society in a spirit of truth, 
justice, solidarity, and freedom. 

2256 Citizens are obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of civil authorities when they 
are contrary to the demands of the moral order. “We must obey God rather than men” (.Acts 5:29). 

2257 Every society’s judgments and conduct reflect a vision of man and his destiny. Without the 
light the Gospel sheds on God and man, societies easily become totalitarian.

ARTICLE 5 

THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT 


You shall not kill.24 

You have heard that it was said to the men of old, “You shall not kill: and whoever kills shall 
be liable to judgment.” But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be 
liable to judgment.22 

2258 “Human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of God and it 
remains for ever in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole end. God alone is the 
Lord of life from its beginning until its end: no one can under any circumstance claim for himself 
the right directly to destroy an innocent human being.”22 ( 356 ) 

I. Respect for Human Life 

The witness of sacred history 

2259 In the account of Abel’s murder by his brother Cain, 27 Scripture reveals the presence of anger 
and envy in man, consequences of original sin, from the beginning of human history. Man has 
become the enemy of his fellow man. God declares the wickedness of this fratricide: “What have 
you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are 
cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your 
hand.”22 ( 401 ) 







2260 The covenant between God and mankind is interwoven with reminders of God’s gift of 
human life and man’s murderous violence: 

For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning.... Whoever sheds the blood of man, by 
man shall his blood be shed; for God made man in his own imaged 

The Old Testament always considered blood a sacred sign of life.^ This teaching remains 
necessary for all time. 

2261 Scripture specifies the prohibition contained in the fifth commandment: “Do not slay the 
innocent and the righteous.The deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to 
the dignity of the human being, to the golden rule, and to the holiness of the Creator. The law 
forbidding it is universally valid: it obliges each and everyone, always and everywhere. 1 1756 . 
1956 1 

2262 In the Sermon on the Mount, the Lord recalls the commandment, “You shall not kill,”^ and 
adds to it the proscription of anger, hatred, and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his disciples 
to turn the other cheek, to love their enemies.^2 He did not defend himself and told Peter to leave 
his sword in its sheath.^ ( 2844 ) 

Legitimate defense 

2263 The legitimate defense of persons and societies is not an exception to the prohibition against 
the murder of the innocent that constitutes intentional killing. “The act of self-defense can have a 
double effect: the preservation of one’s own life; and the killing of the aggressor.... The one is 
intended, the other is not.”^ ( 1737 ) 

2264 Love toward oneself remains a fundamental principle of morality. Therefore it is legitimate to 
insist on respect for one’s own right to life. Someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder 
even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow: 1 2196 1 

If a man in self-defense uses more than necessary violence, it will be unlawful: whereas if he 
repels force with moderation, his defense will be lawful.... Nor is it necessary for salvation that 
a man omit the act of moderate self-defense to avoid killing the other man, since one is bound 
to take more care of one’s own life than of another’s.^ 

2265 Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the 
lives of others. The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered 







unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to 
use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility. (2240) 

2266 The efforts of the state to curb the spread of behavior harmful to people’s rights and to the 
basic rules of civil society correspond to the requirement of safeguarding the common good. 
Legitimate public authority has the right and the duty to inflict punishment proportionate to the 
gravity of the offense. Punishment has the primary aim of redressing the disorder introduced by the 
offense. When it is willingly accepted by the guilty party, it assumes the value of expiation. 
Punishment then, in addition to defending public order and protecting people’s safety, has a 
medicinal purpose: as far as possible, it must contribute to the correction of the guilty party. hZ 
1 1897-1898 . 2308) 

2267 Assuming that the guilty party’s identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the 
traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only 
possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor. (2306) 

If, however, non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people’s safety from the 
aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete 
conditions of the common good and more in conformity with the dignity of the human person. 

Today, in fact, as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has for effectively 
preventing crime, by rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm— 
without definitively taking away from him the possibility of redeeming himself—the cases in 
which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity “are very rare, if not practically non¬ 
existent.”^ 

Intentional homicide 

2268 The fifth commandment forbids direct and intentional killing as gravely sinful. The murderer 
and those who cooperate voluntarily in murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for 
vengeance.^ ( 1867 ) 

Infanticide,ZS fratricide, parricide, and the murder of a spouse are especially grave crimes by 
reason of the natural bonds which they break. Concern for eugenics or public health cannot justify 
any murder, even if commanded by public authority. 

2269 The fifth commandment forbids doing anything with the intention of indirectly bringing about 
a person’s death. The moral law prohibits exposing someone to mortal danger without grave 
reason, as well as refusing assistance to a person in danger. ( 2290 ) 








The acceptance by human society of murderous famines, without efforts to remedy them, is a 
scandalous injustice and a grave offense. Those whose usurious and avaricious dealings lead to the 
hunger and death of their brethren in the human family indirectly commit homicide, which is 
imputable to thermal 

Unintentional killing is not morally imputable. But one is not exonerated from grave offense 
if, without proportionate reasons, he has acted in a way that brings about someone’s death, even 
without the intention to do so. 

Abortion 

2270 Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From 
the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a 
person—among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life. 22 ( 1703 . 357) 

Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you.22 

My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately wrought in 
the depths of the earth.24 

2271 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This 
teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed 
either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: 

You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish.25 

God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men 
must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost 
care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes. 22 

2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the 
canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. “A person who procures a 
completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae ,”22 “by the very commission of the 
offense, ”2^ and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law.22 The Church does not thereby 
intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, 
the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the 
whole of society. (1463) 





2273 The inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual is a constitutive element of a 
civil society and its legislation: (1930) 

“The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the 
political authority. These human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on parents; nor do 
they represent a concession made by society and the state; they belong to human nature and are 
inherent in the person by virtue of the creative act from which the person took his origin. Among 
such fundamental rights one should mention in this regard every human being’s right to life and 
physical integrity from the moment of conception until death.”^ 

“The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of the protection which civil 
legislation ought to accord them, the state is denying the equality of all before the law. When the 
state does not place its power at the service of the rights of each citizen, and in particular of the 
more vulnerable, the very foundations of a state based on law are undermined.... As a consequence 
of the respect and protection which must be ensured for the unborn child from the moment of 
conception, the law must provide appropriate penal sanctions for every deliberate violation of the 
child’s rights. 

2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its 
integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being. 

Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, “if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human 
fetus and is directed toward its safeguarding or healing as an individual.... It is gravely opposed to 
the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon 
the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence.”^ 

2275 “One must hold as licit procedures carried out on the human embryo which respect the life 
and integrity of the embryo and do not involve disproportionate risks for it, but are directed toward 
its healing, the improvement of its condition of health, or its individual survival.”^ 

“It is immoral to produce human embryos intended for exploitation as disposable biological 

material.”^ 

“Certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance are not therapeutic but are 
aimed at producing human beings selected according to sex or other predetermined qualities. Such 
manipulations are contrary to the personal dignity of the human being and his integrity and 
identity”— which are unique and unrepeatable. 

Euthanasia 


2276 Those whose lives are diminished or weakened deserve special respect. Sick or handicapped 



persons should be helped to lead lives as normal as possible. ( 1503 ) 


2277 Whatever its motives and means, direct euthanasia consists in putting an end to the lives of 
handicapped, sick, or dying persons. It is morally unacceptable. 

Thus an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death in order to eliminate 
suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the 
respect due to the living God, his Creator. The error of judgment into which one can fall in good 
faith does not change the nature of this murderous act, which must always be forbidden and 
excluded. 

2278 Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome, dangerous, extraordinary, or 
disproportionate to the expected outcome can be legitimate; it is the refusal of “over-zealous” 
treatment. Here one does not will to cause death; one’s inability to impede it is merely accepted. 
The decisions should be made by the patient if he is competent and able or, if not, by those legally 
entitled to act for the patient, whose reasonable will and legitimate interests must always be 
respected. (1007) 

2279 Even if death is thought imminent, the ordinary care owed to a sick person cannot be 
legitimately interrupted. The use of painkillers to alleviate the sufferings of the dying, even at the 
risk of shortening their days, can be morally in conformity with human dignity if death is not willed 
as either an end or a means, but only foreseen and tolerated as inevitable. Palliative care is a special 
form of disinterested charity. As such it should be encouraged. 

Suicide 

2280 Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given it to him. It is God who 
remains the sovereign Master of life. We are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his 
honor and the salvation of our souls. We are stewards, not owners, of the life God has entrusted to 
us. It is not ours to dispose of. (2258) 

2281 Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to preserve and perpetuate his 
life. It is gravely contrary to the just love of self. It likewise offends love of neighbor because it 
unjustly breaks the ties of solidarity with family, nation, and other human societies to which we 
continue to have obligations. Suicide is contrary to love for the living God. ( 2212 ) 

2282 If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example, especially to the young, it 
also takes on the gravity of scandal. Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law. 






( 1735 ) 

Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can 
diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide. 

2283 We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives. By 
ways known to him alone, God can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. The Church 
prays for persons who have taken their own lives. ( 1037 ) 

II. Respect for the Dignity of Persons 

Respect for the souls of others: scandal 

2284 Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives 
scandal becomes his neighbor’s tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his 
brother into spiritual death. Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission another is deliberately 
led into a grave offense. ( 2847 1 

2285 Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the 
weakness of those who are scandalized. It prompted our Lord to utter this curse: “Whoever causes 
one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone 
fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.”^ Scandal is grave when given 
by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus reproaches the 
scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to wolves in sheep’s clothing.^ (1903) 

2286 Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions, by fashion or opinion. 1 1887 . 2498 1 
Therefore, they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social structures leading to the 

decline of morals and the corruption of religious practice, or to “social conditions that, intentionally 
or not, make Christian conduct and obedience to the Commandments difficult and practically 
impossible.”^ This is also true of business leaders who make rules encouraging fraud, teachers 
who provoke their children to anger, ^ or manipulators of public opinion who turn it away from 
moral values. 

2287 Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way that it leads others to do wrong 
becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for the evil that he has directly or indirectly encouraged. 
“Temptations to sin are sure to come; but woe to him by whom they come!”^ 


Respect for health 








2288 Life and physical health are precious gifts entrusted to us by God. We must take reasonable 
care of them, taking into account the needs of others and the common good. (1503,1509) 

Concern for the health of its citizens requires that society help in the attainment of living- 
conditions that allow them to grow and reach maturity: food and clothing, housing, health care, 
basic education, employment, and social assistance. 

2289 If morality requires respect for the life of the body, it does not make it an absolute value. It 
rejects a neo-pagan notion that tends to promote the cult of the body, to sacrifice everything for its 
sake, to idolize physical perfection and success at sports. By its selective preference of the strong 
over the weak, such a conception can lead to the perversion of human relationships. (364, 2113 1 

2290 The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse of food, 
alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, 
endanger their own and others’ safety on the road, at sea, or in the air. (1809) 

2291 The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on human health and life. Their use, except on 
strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense. Clandestine production of and trafficking in drugs 
are scandalous practices. They constitute direct co-operation in evil, since they encourage people to 
practices gravely contrary to the moral law. 

Respect for the person and scientific research 

2292 Scientific, medical, or psychological experiments on human individuals or groups can 
contribute to healing the sick and the advancement of public health. 

2293 Basic scientific research, as well as applied research, is a significant expression of man’s 
dominion over creation. Science and technology are precious resources when placed at the service 
of man and promote his integral development for the benefit of all. By themselves however they 
cannot disclose the meaning of existence and of human progress. Science and technology are 
ordered to man, from whom they take their origin and development; hence they find in the person 
and in his moral values both evidence of their purpose and awareness of their limits. (159, 1703 1 

2294 It is an illusion to claim moral neutrality in scientific research and its applications. On the 
other hand, guiding principles cannot be inferred from simple technical efficiency, or from the 
usefulness accruing to some at the expense of others or, even worse, from prevailing ideologies. 
Science and technology by their very nature require unconditional respect for fundamental moral 
criteria. They must be at the service of the human person, of his inalienable rights, of his true and 









integral good, in conformity with the plan and the will of God. (2375) 


2295 Research or experimentation on the human being cannot legitimate acts that are in themselves 
contrary to the dignity of persons and to the moral law. The subjects’ potential consent does not 
justify such acts. Experimentation on human beings is not morally legitimate if it exposes the 
subject’s life or physical and psychological integrity to disproportionate or avoidable risks. 
Experimentation on human beings does not conform to the dignity of the person if it takes place 
without the informed consent of the subject or those who legitimately speak for him. ( 1753 1 

2296 Organ transplants are in conformity with the moral law if the physical and psychological 
dangers and risks to the donor are proportionate to the good that is sought for the recipient. Organ 
donation after death is a noble and meritorous act and is to be encouraged as an expression of 
generous solidarity. It is not morally acceptable if the donor or his proxy has not given explicit 
consent. Moreover, it is not morally admissible directly to bring about the disabling mutilation or 
death of a human being, even in order to delay the death of other persons. (2301) 

Respect for bodily integrity 

2297 Kidnapping and hostage taking bring on a reign of terror; by means of threats they subject 
their victims to intolerable pressures. They are morally wrong. Terrorism threatens, wounds, and 
kills indiscriminately; it is gravely against justice and charity. Torture which uses physical or moral 
violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary 
to respect for the person and for human dignity. Except when performed for strictly therapeutic 
medical reasons, directly intended amputations, mutilations, and sterilizations performed on 
innocent persons are against the moral law.21 

2298 In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law 
and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their 
own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the 
Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent 
times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order, nor in 
conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to 
ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims 
and their tormentors. (2267) 


Respect for the dead 






2299 The dying should be given attention and care to help them live their last moments in dignity 
and peace. They will be helped by the prayer of their relatives, who must see to it that the sick 
receive at the proper time the sacraments that prepare them to meet the living God. (1525) 

2300 The bodies of the dead must be treated with respect and charity, in faith and hope of the 
Resurrection. The burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy;^ it honors the children of God, 
who are temples of the Holy Spirit. 1 1681-1690 1 

2301 Autopsies can be morally permitted for legal inquests or scientific research. The free gift of 
organs after death is legitimate and can be meritorious. 

The Church permits cremation, provided that it does not demonstrate a denial of faith in the 
resurrection of the body.23 

III. Safeguarding Peace 

Peace 

2302 By recalling the commandment, “You shall not kill, ”24 0 ur Lord asked for peace of heart and 
denounced murderous anger and hatred as immoral. (1765) 

Anger is a desire for revenge. “To desire vengeance in order to do evil to someone who should be 
punished is illicit,” but it is praiseworthy to impose restitution “to correct vices and maintain 
justice. ”22 If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor, it 
is gravely against charity; it is a mortal sin. The Lord says, “Everyone who is angry with his brother 
shall be liable to judgment. ”2b 

2303 Deliberate hatred is contrary to charity. Hatred of the neighbor is a sin when one deliberately 
wishes him evil. Hatred of the neighbor is a grave sin when one deliberately desires him grave 
harm. “But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may 
be sons of your Father who is in heaven.”22 ( 2094 . 1933 ) 

2304 Respect for and development of human life require peace. Peace is not merely the absence of 
war, and it is not limited to maintaining a balance of powers between adversaries. Peace cannot be 
attained on earth without safeguarding the goods of persons, free communication among men, 
respect for the dignity of persons and peoples, and the assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace is “the 
tranquillity of order.”22 Peace is the work of justice and the effect of charity.22 ( 1909 . 1807 1 


2305 Earthly peace is the image and fruit of the peace of Christ, the messianic “Prince of 









Peace.”100 gy t h e bi 0 od of his Cross, “in his own person he killed the hostility, ”121 he reconciled 
men with God and made his Church the sacrament of the unity of the human race and of its union 
with God. “He is our peace. ”222 He has declared: “Blessed are the peacemakers. ”121 (1468) 

2306 Those who renounce violence and bloodshed and, in order to safeguard human rights, make 
use of those means of defense available to the weakest, bear witness to evangelical charity, 
provided they do so without harming the rights and obligations of other men and societies. They 
bear legitimate witness to the gravity of the physical and moral risks of recourse to violence, with 
all its destruction and death.12! (2267) 

Avoiding war 

2307 The fifth commandment forbids the intentional destruction of human life. Because of the evils 
and injustices that accompany all war, the Church insistently urges everyone to prayer and to action 
so that the divine Goodness may free us from the ancient bondage of war. 121 

2308 All citizens and all governments are obliged to work for the avoidance of war. ( 2266 ) 
However, “as long as the danger of war persists and there is no international authority with the 

necessary competence and power, governments cannot be denied the right of lawful self-defense, 
once all peace efforts have failed.”122 

2309 The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force require rigorous consideration. 
The gravity of such a decision makes it subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy. At one 
and the same time: (2243, 1897 1 

—the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, 
grave, and certain; 

—all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective; 
—there must be serious prospects of success; 

—the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated. 
The power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this 
condition. 

These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the “just war” doctrine. 

The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the prudential judgment of 
those who have responsibility for the common good. 







2310 Public authorities, in this case, have the right and duty to impose on citizens the obligations 
necessary for national defense. (2239, 1909) 

Those who are sworn to serve their country in the armed forces are servants of the security and 
freedom of nations. If they carry out their duty honorably, they truly contribute to the common 
good of the nation and the maintenance of peace.dQZ 

2311 Public authorities should make equitable provision for those who for reasons of conscience 
refuse to bear arms; these are nonetheless obliged to serve the human community in some other 
way.i^ Q782 .1790) 

2312 The Church and human reason both assert the permanent validity of the moral law during 
armed conflict “The mere fact that war has regrettably broken out does not mean that everything 
becomes licit between the warring parties.”!^ 

2313 Non-combatants, wounded soldiers, and prisoners must be respected and treated humanely. 
(2242) 

Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes, as 
are the orders that command such actions. Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who 
carry them out. Thus the extermination of a people, nation, or ethnic minority must be condemned 
as a mortal sin. One is morally bound to resist orders that command genocide. 

2314 “Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with 
their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal 
condemnation.”!!! A danger of modern warfare is that it provides the opportunity to those who 
possess modern scientific weapons—especially atomic, biological, or chemical weapons—to 
commit such crimes. 

2315 The accumulation of arms strikes many as a paradoxically suitable way of deterring potential 
adversaries from war. They see it as the most effective means of ensuring peace among nations. 
This method of deterrence gives rise to strong moral reservations. The arms race does not ensure 
peace. Far from eliminating the causes of war, it risks aggravating them. Spending enormous sums 
to produce ever new types of weapons impedes efforts to aid needy populations;!!^ it thwarts the 
development of peoples. Over-armament multiplies reasons for conflict and increases the danger of 
escalation. 

2316 The production and the sale of arms affect the common good of nations and of the 
international community. Hence public authorities have the right and duty to regulate them. The 








short-term pursuit of private or collective interests cannot legitimate undertakings that promote 
violence and conflict among nations and compromise the international juridical order. (1906) 


2317 Injustice, excessive economic or social inequalities, envy, distrust, and pride raging among 
men and nations constantly threaten peace and cause wars. Everything done to overcome these 
disorders contributes to building up peace and avoiding war: ( 1938 . 2538 . 1941 1 

Insofar as men are sinners, the threat of war hangs over them and will so continue until Christ 
comes again; but insofar as they can vanquish sin by coming together in charity, violence itself 
will be vanquished and these words will be fulfilled: “they shall beat their swords into 
plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, 
neither shall they learn war any more.”H2 


IN BRIEF 

2318 “In [God’s] hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind” (Job 12:10). 

2319 Every human life, from the moment of conception until death, is sacred because the human 
person has been willed for its own sake in the image and likeness of the living and holy God. 

2320 The murder of a human being is gravely contrary to the dignity of the person and the holiness 
of the Creator. 

2321 The prohibition of murder does not abrogate the right to render an unjust aggressor unable to 
inflict harm. Legitimate defense is a grave duty for whoever is responsible for the lives of others or 
the common good. 

2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as 
an end or as a means, is a “criminal” practice (GS 27 § 3), gravely contrary to the moral law. The 
Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life. 

2323 Because it should be treated as a person from conception, the embryo must be defended in its 
integrity, cared for, and healed like every other human being. 

2324 Intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder. It is gravely contrary to the 
dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator. 








2325 Suicide is seriously contrary to justice, hope, and charity. It is forbidden by the fifth 
commandment. 

2326 Scandal is a grave offense when by deed or omission it deliberately leads others to sin 
gravely. 

2327 Because of the evils and injustices that all war brings with it, we must do everything 
reasonably possible to avoid it. The Church prays: “From famine, pestilence, and war, O Lord, 
deliver us.” 

2328 The Church and human reason assert the permanent validity of the moral law during armed 
conflicts. Practices deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal principles are 
crimes. 

2329 “The arms race is one of the greatest curses on the human race and the harm it inflicts on the 
poor is more than can be endured” (GS 81 § 3). 

2330 “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God” (Mt 5:9).

ARTICLE 6 

THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT 


You shall not commit adultery. HL2 

You have heard that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.” But I say to you that every 
one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. HI 

I. “Male and Female He Created Them...” 369-373 

2331 “God is love and in himself he lives a mystery of personal loving communion. Creating the 
human race in his own image... , God inscribed in the humanity of man and woman the vocation, 
and thus the capacity and responsibility, of love and communion.”H2 (1604) 

“God created man in his own image... male and female he created them”;112 He blessed them 
and said, “Be fruitful and multiplying “When God created man, he made him in the likeness of 
God. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were 

created.”HL2 






2332 Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul. It 
especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the 
aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others. (362) 

2333 Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity. Physical, 
moral, and spiritual difference and complementarity are oriented toward the goods of marriage and 
the flourishing of family life. The harmony of the couple and of society depends in part on the way 
in which the complementarity, needs, and mutual support between the sexes are lived out. ( 1603 1 

2334 “In creating men ‘male and female,’ God gives man and woman an equal personal 
dignity.”^ “Man is a person, man and woman equally so, since both were created in the image 
and likeness of the personal God.”l^ ( 357 1 

2335 Each of the two sexes is an image of the power and tenderness of God, with equal dignity 
though in a different way. The union of man and woman in marriage is a way of imitating in the 
flesh the Creator’s generosity and fecundity: “Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and 
cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh. ”1^1 All human generations proceed from this 
union.l^ ( 2205 1 

2336 Jesus came to restore creation to the purity of its origins. In the Sermon on the Mount, he 
interprets God’s plan strictly: “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 
But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with 
her in his heart.”!^ What God has joined together, let not man put asunder.^4 ( 1614 1 

The tradition of the Church has understood the sixth commandment as encompassing the 
whole of human sexuality. 

II. The Vocation to Chastity 

2337 Chastity means the successful integration of sexuality within the person and thus the inner 
unity of man in his bodily and spiritual being. Sexuality, in which man’s belonging to the bodily 
and biological world is expressed, becomes personal and truly human when it is integrated into the 
relationship of one person to another, in the complete and lifelong mutual gift of a man and a 
woman. ( 2349 . 2520 1 

The virtue of chastity therefore involves the integrity of the person and the integrality of the 

gift. 


The integrity of the person 









2338 The chaste person maintains the integrity of the powers of life and love placed in him. This 
integrity ensures the unity of the person; it is opposed to any behavior that would impair it. It 
tolerates neither a double life nor duplicity in speech.!^ 

2339 Chastity includes an apprenticeship in self-mastery which is a training in human freedom. 
The alternative is clear: either man governs his passions and finds peace, or he lets himself be 
dominated by them and becomes unhappy.!^ “Man’s dignity therefore requires him to act out of 
conscious and free choice, as moved and drawn in a personal way from within, and not by blind 
impulses in himself or by mere external constraint. Man gains such dignity when, ridding himself 
of all slavery to the passions, he presses forward to his goal by freely choosing what is good and, 
by his diligence and skill, effectively secures for himself the means suited to this end.”l^ (1767) 

2340 Whoever wants to remain faithful to his baptismal promises and resist temptations will want 
to adopt the means for doing so: self-knowledge, practice of an ascesis adapted to the situations that 
confront him, obedience to God’s commandments, exercise of the moral virtues, and fidelity to 
prayer. “Indeed it is through chastity that we are gathered together and led back to the unity from 
which we were fragmented into multiplicity.”!^ 1 2015 1 

2341 The virtue of chastity comes under the cardinal virtue of temperance, which seeks to permeate 
the passions and appetites of the senses with reason. 1 1809 1 

2342 Self-mastery is a long and exacting work. One can never consider it acquired once and for all. 
It presupposes renewed effort at all stages of life.l^ The effort required can be more intense in 
certain periods, such as when the personality is being formed during childhood and adolescence. 
1 409 1 

2343 Chastity has laws of growth which progress through stages marked by imperfection and too 
often by sin. “Man... day by day builds himself up through his many free decisions; and so he 
knows, loves, and accomplishes moral good by stages of growth.”!^ 1 2223 1 

2344 Chastity represents an eminently personal task; it also involves a cultural effort, for there is 
“an interdependence between personal betterment and the improvement of society.”!^! Chastity 
presupposes respect for the rights of the person, in particular the right to receive information and an 
education that respect the moral and spiritual dimensions of human life. (2525) 

2345 Chastity is a moral virtue. It is also a gift from God, a grace, a fruit of spiritual effort.!^ The 
Holy Spirit enables one whom the water of Baptism has regenerated to imitate the purity of 








Christ.!^ (1810) 


The integrality of the gift of self 

2346 Charity is the form of all the virtues. Under its influence, chastity appears as a school of the 
gift of the person. Self-mastery is ordered to the gift of self. Chastity leads him who practices it to 
become a witness to his neighbor of God’s fidelity and loving kindness. ( 1827 . 210 1 

2347 The virtue of chastity blossoms in friendship. It shows the disciple how to follow and imitate 
him who has chosen us as his friends,^ w ho has given himself totally to us and allows us to 
participate in his divine estate. Chastity is a promise of immortality. (374) 

Chastity is expressed notably in friendship with one’s neighbor. Whether it develops between 
persons of the same or opposite sex, friendship represents a great good for all. It leads to spiritual 
communion. 

The various forms of chastity 

2348 All the baptized are called to chastity. The Christian has “put on Christ,”!^ the model for all 
chastity. All Christ’s faithful are called to lead a chaste life in keeping with their particular states of 
life. At the moment of his Baptism, the Christian is pledged to lead his affective life in chastity. 

2349 “People should cultivate [chastity] in the way that is suited to their state of life. Some profess 
virginity or consecrated celibacy which enables them to give themselves to God alone with an 
undivided heart in a remarkable manner. Others live in the way prescribed for all by the moral law, 
whether they are married or single.”!^ Married people are called to live conjugal chastity; others 
practice chastity in continence: [ 1620 1 

There are three forms of the virtue of chastity: the first is that of spouses, the second that of 
widows, and the third that of virgins. We do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the 
others.... This is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the Church.!^ 

2350 Those who are engaged to marry are called to live chastity in continence. They should see in 
this time of testing a discovery of mutual respect, an apprenticeship in fidelity, and the hope of 
receiving one another from God. They should reserve for marriage the expressions of affection that 
belong to married love. They will help each other grow in chastity. ( 1632 ) 


Offenses against chastity 








2351 Lust is disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of sexual pleasure. Sexual pleasure is 
morally disordered when sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes. 
(2528) 

2352 By masturbation is to be understood the deliberate stimulation of the genital organs in order 
to derive sexual pleasure. “Both the Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant 
tradition, and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that 
masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action.”!^ “The deliberate use of the sexual 
faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose.” For here 
sexual pleasure is sought outside of “the sexual relationship which is demanded by the moral order 
and in which the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true 
love is achieved.”!^ (1735) 

To form an equitable judgment about the subjects’ moral responsibility and to guide pastoral 
action, one must take into account the affective immaturity, force of acquired habit, conditions of 
anxiety, or other psychological or social factors that can lessen, if not even reduce to a minimum, 
moral culpability. 

2353 Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. It is gravely 
contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality which is naturally ordered to the good of 
spouses and the generation and education of children. Moreover, it is a grave scandal when there is 
corruption of the young. 

2354 Pornography consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts from the intimacy of the 
partners, in order to display them deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it 
perverts the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave injury to the 
dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), since each one becomes an object of base 
pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy 
world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of 
pornographic materials. (2523) 

2355 Prostitution does injury to the dignity of the person who engages in it, reducing the person to 
an instrument of sexual pleasure. The one who pays sins gravely against himself: he violates the 
chastity to which his Baptism pledged him and defiles his body, the temple of the Holy Spirit.142 
Prostitution is a social scourge. It usually involves women, but also men, children, and adolescents 
(The latter two cases involve the added sin of scandal.). While it is always gravely sinful to engage 
in prostitution, the imputability of the offense can be attenuated by destitution, blackmail, or social 





pressure. (1735) 


2356 Rape is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of another person. It does injury to justice 
and charity. Rape deeply wounds the respect, freedom, and physical and moral integrity to which 
every person has a right. It causes grave damage that can mark the victim for life. It is always an 
intrinsically evil act. Graver still is the rape of children committed by parents (incest) or those 
responsible for the education of the children entrusted to them. 1 2297 . 1756 . 2388 1 

Chastity and homosexuality 

2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an 
exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great 
variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains 
largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of 
grave depravity,tradition has always declared that “homosexual acts are intrinsically 
disordered.”!^ They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. 
They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances 
can they be approved. ( 2333 1 

2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not 
negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. 
They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust 
discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God’s will in 
their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord’s Cross the difficulties 
they may encounter from their condition. 

2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them 
inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, 
they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection. 1 2347 1 

III. The Love of Husband and Wife 

2360 Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In marriage the physical 
intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds 
between baptized persons are sanctified by the sacrament. ( 1601 ) 


2361 “Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves to one another through the 









acts which are proper and exclusive to spouses, is not something simply biological, but concerns 
the innermost being of the human person as such. It is realized in a truly human way only if it is an 
integral part of the love by which a man and woman commit themselves totally to one another until 
death ”143 q 643 . 2332 . 1611 1 

Tobias got out of bed and said to Sarah, “Sister, get up, and let us pray and implore our Lord 
that he grant us mercy and safety.” So she got up, and they began to pray and implore that they 
might be kept safe. Tobias began by saying, “Blessed are you, O God of our fathers.... You 
made Adam, and for him you made his wife Eve as a helper and support. From the two of 
them the race of mankind has sprung. You said, Tt is not good that the man should be alone; 
let us make a helper for him like himself.’ I now am taking this kinswoman of mine, not 
because of lust, but with sincerity. Grant that she and I may find mercy and that we may grow 
old together.” And they both said, “Amen, Amen.” Then they went to sleep for the night.144 

2362 “The acts in marriage by which the intimate and chaste union of the spouses takes place are 
noble and honorable; the truly human performance of these acts fosters the self-giving they signify 
and enriches the spouses in joy and gratitude. ”145 Sexuality is a source of joy and pleasure: 

The Creator himself... established that in the [generative] function, spouses should experience 
pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit. Therefore, the spouses do nothing evil in seeking 
this pleasure and enjoyment. They accept what the Creator has intended for them. At the same 
time, spouses should know how to keep themselves within the limits of just moderation.l4h 

2363 The spouses’ union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the good of the spouses themselves 
and the transmission of life. These two meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated without 
altering the couple’s spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage and the future of the 
family. 

The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold obligation of fidelity and 
fecundity. 

Conjugal fidelity 1646-1648 

2364 The married couple forms “the intimate partnership of life and love established by the Creator 
and governed by his laws; it is rooted in the conjugal covenant, that is, in their irrevocable personal 
consent.”44Z Both give themselves definitively and totally to one another. They are no longer two; 
from now on they form one flesh. The covenant they freely contracted imposes on the spouses the 
obligation to preserve it as unique and indissoluble.^ “What therefore God has joined together, let 






not man put asunder.”!^ ( 1603 . 1615 1 


2365 Fidelity expresses constancy in keeping one’s given word. God is faithful. The Sacrament of 
Matrimony enables man and woman to enter into Christ’s fidelity for his Church. Through conjugal 
chastity, they bear witness to this mystery before the world. ( 1640 ) 

St. John Chrysostom suggests that young husbands should say to their wives: I have taken you 
in my arms, and I love you, and I prefer you to my life itself. For the present life is nothing, 
and my most ardent dream is to spend it with you in such a way that we may be assured of not 
being separated in the life reserved for us.... I place your love above all things, and nothing 
would be more bitter or painful to me than to be of a different mind than you.1^2 

The fecundity of marriage 1652-1653 

2366 Fecundity is a gift, an end of marriage, for conjugal love naturally tends to be fruitful. A child 
does not come from outside as something added on to the mutual love of the spouses, but springs 
from the very heart of that mutual giving, as its fruit and fulfillment. So the Church, which is “on 
the side of life,”i^l teaches that “it is necessary that each and every marriage act remain ordered 
per se to the procreation of human life. ”152 “This particular doctrine, expounded on numerous 
occasions by the Magisterium, is based on the inseparable connection, established by God, which 
man on his own initiative may not break, between the unitive significance and the procreative 
significance which are both inherent to the marriage act.”G&gt;3 

2367 Called to give life, spouses share in the creative power and fatherhood of God.154 “Married 
couples should regard it as their proper mission to transmit human life and to educate their children; 
they should realize that they are thereby cooperating with the love of God the Creator and are, in a 
certain sense, its interpreters. They will fulfill this duty with a sense of human and Christian 
responsibility.”!^ ( 2205 1 

2368 A particular aspect of this responsibility concerns the regulation of procreation. For just 
reasons, spouses may wish to space the births of their children. It is their duty to make certain that 
their desire is not motivated by selfishness but is in conformity with the generosity appropriate to 
responsible parenthood. Moreover, they should conform their behavior to the objective criteria of 
morality: 

When it is a question of harmonizing married love with the responsible transmission of life, 
the morality of the behavior does not depend on sincere intention and evaluation of motives 







alone; but it must be determined by objective criteria, criteria drawn from the nature of the 
person and his acts, criteria that respect the total meaning of mutual self-giving and human 
procreation in the context of true love; this is possible only if the virtue of married chastity is 
practiced with sincerity of heart.i^ 

2369 “By safeguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive and the procreative, the conjugal act 
preserves in its fullness the sense of true mutual love and its orientation toward man’s exalted 
vocation to parenthood.”^ 

2370 Periodic continence, that is, the methods of birth regulation based on self-observation and the 
use of infertile periods, is in conformity with the objective criteria of morality.^ These methods 
respect the bodies of the spouses, encourage tenderness between them, and favor the education of 
an authentic freedom. In contrast, “every action which, whether in anticipation of the conjugal act, 
or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as 
an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible” is intrinsically evil;!^ 

Thus the innate language that expresses the total reciprocal self-giving of husband and wife is 
overlaid, through contraception, by an objectively contradictory language, namely, that of not 
giving oneself totally to the other. This leads not only to a positive refusal to be open to life 
but also to a falsification of the inner truth of conjugal love, which is called upon to give itself 
in personal totality.... The difference, both anthropological and moral, between contraception 
and recourse to the rhythm of the cycle... involves in the final analysis two irreconcilable 
concepts of the human person and of human sexuality.^ 

2371 “Let all be convinced that human life and the duty of transmitting it are not limited by the 
horizons of this life only: their true evaluation and full significance can be understood only in 
reference to man’s eternal destiny .”lhl (1703 ) 

2372 The state has a responsibility for its citizens’ well-being. In this capacity it is legitimate for it 
to intervene to orient the demography of the population. This can be done by means of objective 
and respectful information, but certainly not by authoritarian, coercive measures. The state may not 
legitimately usurp the initiative of spouses, who have the primary responsibility for the procreation 
and education of their children.^ i n this area, it is not authorized to employ means contrary to the 
moral law. (2209) 


The gift of a child 




2373 Sacred Scripture and the Church’s traditional practice see in large families a sign of God’s 
blessing and the parents’ generosity.!^ 

2374 Couples who discover that they are sterile suffer greatly. “What will you give me,” asks 
Abraham of God, “for I continue childless?”!^ And Rachel cries to her husband Jacob, “Give me 
children, or I shall die! ”1^2 (1654) 

2375 Research aimed at reducing human sterility is to be encouraged, on condition that it is placed 
“at the service of the human person, of his inalienable rights, and his true and integral good 
according to the design and will of God.”!^ ( 2293 ) 

2376 Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person other 
than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral. These 
techniques (heterologous artificial insemination and fertilization) infringe the child’s right to be 
born of a father and mother known to him and bound to each other by marriage. They betray the 
spouses’ “right to become a father and a mother only through each other.”!^ 

2377 Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and 
fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the 
sexual act from the procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act 
by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that “entrusts the life and identity of 
the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology 
over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself 
contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children.”!^ “Under the 
moral aspect procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not willed as the fruit of the 
conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of the spouses’ union.... Only respect for the link 
between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make 
possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person.”!^ 

2378 A child is not something owed to one, but is a gift. The “supreme gift of marriage” is a human 
person. A child may not be considered a piece of property, an idea to which an alleged “right to a 
child” would lead. In this area, only the child possesses genuine rights: the right “to be the fruit of 
the specific act of the conjugal love of his parents,” and “the right to be respected as a person from 
the moment of his conception.”!^ 

2379 The Gospel shows that physical sterility is not an absolute evil. Spouses who still suffer from 
infertility after exhausting legitimate medical procedures should unite themselves with the Lord’s 




Cross, the source of all spiritual fecundity. They can give expression to their generosity by adopting 
abandoned children or performing demanding services for others. 

IV. Offenses Against the Dignity of Marriage 

Adultery 

2380 Adultery refers to marital infidelity. When two partners, of whom at least one is married to 
another party, have sexual relations—even transient ones—they commit adultery. Christ condemns 
even adultery of mere desire.TLL The sixth commandment and the New Testament forbid adultery 
absolutely.^ The prophets denounce the gravity of adultery; they see it as an image of the sin of 

idolatry.TZd ( 1611 1 

2381 Adultery is an injustice. He who commits adultery fails in his commitment. He does injury to 
the sign of the covenant which the marriage bond is, transgresses the rights of the other spouse, and 
undermines the institution of marriage by breaking the contract on which it is based. He 
compromises the good of human generation and the welfare of children who need their parents’ 
stable union. ( 1640 1 

Divorce 

2382 The Lord Jesus insisted on the original intention of the Creator who willed that marriage be 
indissoluble. TZ4 He abrogates the accommodations that had slipped into the old Law.TZ5 ( 1614 1 

Between the baptized, “a ratified and consummated marriage cannot be dissolved by any 
human power or for any reason other than death.”TZ6 

2383 The separation of spouses while maintaining the marriage bond can be legitimate in certain 
cases provided for by canon law.1T/ ( 1649 1 

If civil divorce remains the only possible way of ensuring certain legal rights, the care of the 
children, or the protection of inheritance, it can be tolerated and does not constitute a moral offense. 

2384 Divorce is a grave offense against the natural law. It claims to break the contract, to which the 
spouses freely consented, to live with each other till death. Divorce does injury to the covenant of 
salvation, of which sacramental marriage is the sign. Contracting a new union, even if it is 
recognized by civil law, adds to the gravity of the rupture: the remarried spouse is then in a 
situation of public and permanent adultery: ( 1650 1 








If a husband, separated from his wife, approaches another woman, he is an adulterer because 
he makes that woman commit adultery; and the woman who lives with him is an adulteress, 
because she has drawn another’s husband to herself. 28 

2385 Divorce is immoral also because it introduces disorder into the family and into society. This 
disorder brings grave harm to the deserted spouse, to children traumatized by the separation of their 
parents and often torn between them, and because of its contagious effect which makes it truly a 
plague on society. 

2386 It can happen that one of the spouses is the innocent victim of a divorce decreed by civil law; 
this spouse therefore has not contravened the moral law. There is a considerable difference between 
a spouse who has sincerely tried to be faithful to the sacrament of marriage and is unjustly 
abandoned, and one who through his own grave fault destroys a canonically valid marriage.^ 
(164Q) 

Other offenses against the dignity of marriage 

2387 The predicament of a man who, desiring to convert to the Gospel, is obliged to repudiate one 
or more wives with whom he has shared years of conjugal life, is understandable. However 
polygamy is not in accord with the moral law. “[Conjugal] communion is radically contradicted by 
polygamy; this, in fact, directly negates the plan of God which was revealed from the beginning, 
because it is contrary to the equal personal dignity of men and women who in matrimony give 
themselves with a love that is total and therefore unique and exclusive.”!^ The Christian who has 
previously lived in polygamy has a grave duty in justice to honor the obligations contracted in 
regard to his former wives and his children. 1 1610 1 

2388 Incest designates intimate relations between relatives or in-laws within a degree that prohibits 
marriage between them.i^L St. Paul stigmatizes this especially grave offense: “It is actually 
reported that there is immorality among you... for a man is living with his father’s wife.... In the 
name of the Lord Jesus... you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.. ..”1^2 
Incest corrupts family relationships and marks a regression toward animality. 1 2356 . 2207 1 

2389 Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by adults on children or adolescents 
entrusted to their care. The offense is compounded by the scandalous harm done to the physical and 
moral integrity of the young, who will remain scarred by it all their lives; and the violation of 
responsibility for their upbringing. 1 2285 1 







2390 In a so-called free union, a man and a woman refuse to give juridical and public form to a 
liaison involving sexual intimacy. 1 1631 . 2353 . 1385 1 

The expression “free union” is fallacious: what can “union” mean when the partners make no 
commitment to one another, each exhibiting a lack of trust in the other, in himself, or in the future? 

The expression covers a number of different situations: concubinage, rejection of marriage as 
such, or inability to make long-term commitments.!^ All these situations offend against the dignity 
of marriage; they destroy the very idea of the family; they weaken the sense of fidelity. They are 
contrary to the moral law. The sexual act must take place exclusively within marriage. Outside of 
marriage it always constitutes a grave sin and excludes one from sacramental communion. 

2391 Some today claim a “right to a trial marriage” where there is an intention of getting married 
later. However firm the purpose of those who engage in premature sexual relations may be, “the 
fact is that such liaisons can scarcely ensure mutual sincerity and fidelity in a relationship between 
a man and a woman, nor, especially, can they protect it from inconstancy of desires or whim.”!^ 
Carnal union is morally legitimate only when a definitive community of life between a man and 
woman has been established. Human love does not tolerate “trial marriages.” It demands a total and 
definitive gift of persons to one another.!^ (2364) 


IN BRIEF 

2392 “Love is the fundamental and innate vocation of every human being” (FC 11). 

2393 By creating the human being man and woman, God gives personal dignity equally to the one 
and the other. Each of them, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity. 

2394 Christ is the model of chastity. Every baptized person is called to lead a chaste life, each 
according to his particular state of life. 

2395 Chastity means the integration of sexuality within the person. It includes an apprenticeship in 
self-mastery. 

2396 Among the sins gravely contrary to chastity are masturbation, fornication, pornography, and 
homosexual practices. 

2397 The covenant which spouses have freely entered into entails faithful love. It imposes on them 
the obligation to keep their marriage indissoluble. 








2398 Fecundity is a good, a gift and an end of marriage. By giving life, spouses participate in 
God’s fatherhood. 

2399 The regulation of births represents one of the aspects of responsible fatherhood and 
motherhood. Legitimate intentions on the part of the spouses do not justify recourse to morally 
unacceptable means (for example, direct sterilization or contraception). 

2400 Adultery, divorce, polygamy, and free union are grave offenses against the dignity of 
marriage.

ARTICLE 7 

THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT 




You shall not steal.i^ 

2401 The seventh commandment forbids unjustly taking or keeping the goods of one’s neighbor 
and wronging him in any way with respect to his goods. It commands justice and charity in the care 
of earthly goods and the fruits of men’s labor. For the sake of the common good, it requires respect 
for the universal destination of goods and respect for the right to private property. Christian life 
strives to order this world’s goods to God and to fraternal charity. ( 1807 . 952) 

I. The Universal Destination and the Private Ownership of Goods 

2402 In the beginning God entrusted the earth and its resources to the common stewardship of 
mankind to take care of them, master them by labor, and enjoy their fruits.The goods of 
creation are destined for the whole human race. However, the earth is divided up among men to 
assure the security of their lives, endangered by poverty and threatened by violence. The 
appropriation of property is legitimate for guaranteeing the freedom and dignity of persons and for 
helping each of them to meet his basic needs and the needs of those in his charge. It should allow 
for a natural solidarity to develop between men. 1 226 . 1939 1 

2403 The right to private property, acquired or received in a just way, does not do away with the 
original gift of the earth to the whole of mankind. The universal destination of goods remains 
primordial, even if the promotion of the common good requires respect for the right to private 
property and its exercise. 

2404 “In his use of things man should regard the external goods he legitimately owns not merely as 
exclusive to himself but common to others also, in the sense that they can benefit others as well as 
himself.”^ The ownership of any property makes its holder a steward of Providence, with the task 
of making it fruitful and communicating its benefits to others, first of all his family. 1 307 1 

2405 Goods of production—material or immaterial—such as land, factories, practical or artistic 
skills, oblige their possessors to employ them in ways that will benefit the greatest number. Those 
who hold goods for use and consumption should use them with moderation, reserving the better 
part for guests, for the sick and the poor. 

2406 Political authority has the right and duty to regulate the legitimate exercise of the right to 
ownership for the sake of the common good.1^2 ( 1903 1 


II. Respect for Persons and Their Goods 








2407 In economic matters, respect for human dignity requires the practice of the virtue of 
temperance, so as to moderate attachment to this world’s goods; the practice of the virtue of justice, 
to preserve our neighbor’s rights and render him what is his due; and the practice of solidarity, in 
accordance with the golden rule and in keeping with the generosity of the Lord, who “though he 
was rich, yet for your sake... became poor so that by his poverty, you might become rich.”12Q 
1 1809 . 1807 . 1939 1 

Respect for the goods of others 

2408 The seventh commandment forbids theft, that is, usurping another’s property against the 
reasonable will of the owner. There is no theft if consent can be presumed or if refusal is contrary 
to reason and the universal destination of goods. This is the case in obvious and urgent necessity 
when the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing... ) is to put at 
one’s disposal and use the property of others.!^ 

2409 Even if it does not contradict the provisions of civil law, any form of unjustly taking and 
keeping the property of others is against the seventh commandment: thus, deliberate retention of 
goods lent or of objects lost; business fraud; paying unjust wages; forcing up prices by taking 
advantage of the ignorance or hardship of another.!^ 1 1867 1 

The following are also morally illicit: speculation in which one contrives to manipulate the 
price of goods artificially in order to gain an advantage to the detriment of others; corruption in 
which one influences the judgment of those who must make decisions according to law; 
appropriation and use for private purposes of the common goods of an enterprise; work poorly 
done; tax evasion; forgery of checks and invoices; excessive expenses and waste. Willfully 
damaging private or public property is contrary to the moral law and requires reparation. 

2410 Promises must be kept and contracts strictly observed to the extent that the commitments 
made in them are morally just. A significant part of economic and social life depends on the 
honoring of contracts between physical or moral persons—commercial contracts of purchase or 
sale, rental or labor contracts. All contracts must be agreed to and executed in good faith. ( 2101 1 

2411 Contracts are subject to commutative justice which regulates exchanges between persons and 
between institutions in accordance with a strict respect for their rights. Commutative justice obliges 
strictly; it requires safeguarding property rights, paying debts, and fulfilling obligations freely 
contracted. Without commutative justice, no other form of justice is possible. ( 1807 1 

One distinguishes commutative justice from legal justice which concerns what the citizen 








owes in fairness to the community, and from distributive justice which regulates what the 
community owes its citizens in proportion to their contributions and needs. 

2412 In virtue of commutative justice, reparation for injustice committed requires the restitution of 
stolen goods to their owner: ( 1459 . 2487 ) 

Jesus blesses Zacchaeus for his pledge: “If I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it 
fourfold.”^ Those who, directly or indirectly, have taken possession of the goods of another, are 
obliged to make restitution of them, or to return the equivalent in kind or in money, if the goods 
have disappeared, as well as the profit or advantages their owner would have legitimately obtained 
from them. Likewise, all who in some manner have taken part in a theft or who have knowingly 
benefited from it—for example, those who ordered it, assisted in it, or received the stolen goods— 
are obliged to make restitution in proportion to their responsibility and to their share of what was 
stolen. 

2413 Games of chance (card games, etc.) or wagers are not in themselves contrary to justice. They 
become morally unacceptable when they deprive someone of what is necessary to provide for his 
needs and those of others. The passion for gambling risks becoming an enslavement. Unfair wagers 
and cheating at games constitute grave matter, unless the damage inflicted is so slight that the one 
who suffers it cannot reasonably consider it significant. 

2414 The seventh commandment forbids acts or enterprises that for any reason—selfish or 
ideological, commercial, or totalitarian—lead to the enslavement of human beings, to their being 
bought, sold and exchanged like merchandise, in disregard for their personal dignity. It is a sin 
against the dignity of persons and their fundamental rights to reduce them by violence to their 
productive value or to a source of profit. St. Paul directed a Christian master to treat his Christian 
slave “no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother,... both in the flesh and in the 
Lord.”— (2297) 

Respect for the integrity of creation 

2415 The seventh commandment enjoins respect for the integrity of creation. Animals, like plants 
and inanimate beings, are by nature destined for the common good of past, present, and future 
humanity.^ Use of the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the universe cannot be 
divorced from respect for moral imperatives. Man’s dominion over inanimate and other living 
beings granted by the Creator is not absolute; it is limited by concern for the quality of life of his 
neighbor, including generations to come; it requires a religious respect for the integrity of 





creation .126 (226, 358, 3Z3, 378 1 


2416 Animals are God’s creatures. He surrounds them with his providential care. By their mere 
existence they bless him and give him glory.!2Z Thus men owe them kindness. We should recall the 
gentleness with which saints like St. Francis of Assisi or St. Philip Neri treated animals. ( 344 ) 

2417 God entrusted animals to the stewardship of those whom he created in his own image. 122 
Hence it is legitimate to use animals for food and clothing. They may be domesticated to help man 
in his work and leisure. Medical and scientific experimentation on animals is a morally acceptable 
practice if it remains within reasonable limits and contributes to caring for or saving human lives. 

(2234) 

2418 It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly. It is likewise 
unworthy to spend money on them that should as a priority go to the relief of human misery. One 
can love animals; one should not direct to them the affection due only to persons. ( 2446 ) 

III. The Social Doctrine of the Church 

2419 “Christian revelation... promotes deeper understanding of the laws of social living.”129 The 
Church receives from the Gospel the full revelation of the truth about man. When she fulfills her 
mission of proclaiming the Gospel, she bears witness to man, in the name of Christ, to his dignity 
and his vocation to the communion of persons. She teaches him the demands of justice and peace in 
conformity with divine wisdom. ( I960 . 359) 

2420 The Church makes a moral judgment about economic and social matters, “when the 
fundamental rights of the person or the salvation of souls requires it.”2QQ In the moral order she 
bears a mission distinct from that of political authorities: the Church is concerned with the temporal 
aspects of the common good because they are ordered to the sovereign Good, our ultimate end. She 
strives to inspire right attitudes with respect to earthly goods and in socio-economic relationships. 
( 2032 . 2246) 

2421 The social doctrine of the Church developed in the nineteenth century when the Gospel 
encountered modern industrial society with its new structures for the production of consumer 
goods, its new concept of society, the state and authority, and its new forms of labor and 
ownership. The development of the doctrine of the Church on economic and social matters attests 
the permanent value of the Church’s teaching at the same time as it attests the true meaning of her 
Tradition, always living and active.=21 













2422 The Church’s social teaching comprises a body of doctrine, which is articulated as the Church 
interprets events in the course of history, with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, in the light of the 
whole of what has been revealed by Jesus Christ.^2 This teaching can be more easily accepted by 
men of good will, the more the faithful let themselves be guided by it. (2044) 

2423 The Church’s social teaching proposes principles for reflection; it provides criteria for 
judgment; it gives guidelines for action: 

Any system in which social relationships are determined entirely by economic factors is 
contrary to the nature of the human person and his acts.^ 

2424 A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end of economic activity is 
morally unacceptable. The disordered desire for money cannot but produce perverse effects. It is 
one of the causes of the many conflicts which disturb the social order.^A system that 
“subordinates the basic rights of individuals and of groups to the collective organization of 
production” is contrary to human dignity.^ Every practice that reduces persons to nothing more 
than a means of profit enslaves man, leads to idolizing money, and contributes to the spread of 
atheism. “You cannot serve God and mammon. ( 2317 1 

2425 The Church has rejected the totalitarian and atheistic ideologies associated in modern times 
with “communism” or “socialism.” She has likewise refused to accept, in the practice of 
“capitalism,” individualism and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human 
labor.202 Regulating the economy solely by centralized planning perverts the basis of social bonds; 
regulating it solely by the law of the marketplace fails social justice, for “there are many human 
needs which cannot be satisfied by the market.”^ Reasonable regulation of the marketplace and 
economic initiatives, in keeping with a just hierarchy of values and a view to the common good, is 
to be commended. (676, 1886 ) 

IV. Economic Activity and Social Justice 

2426 The development of economic activity and growth in production are meant to provide for the 
needs of human beings. Economic life is not meant solely to multiply goods produced and increase 
profit or power; it is ordered first of all to the service of persons, of the whole man, and of the entire 
human community. Economic activity, conducted according to its own proper methods, is to be 
exercised within the limits of the moral order, in keeping with social justice so as to correspond to 
God’s plan for man.2h2 ( 1928 1 







2427 Human work proceeds directly from persons created in the image of God and called to 
prolong the work of creation by subduing the earth, both with and for one another.^ Hence work 
is a duty: “If any one will not work, let him not eat.”2U Work honors the Creator’s gifts and the 
talents received from him. It can also be redemptive. By enduring the hardship of work=-!2 in union 
with Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth and the one crucified on Calvary, man collaborates in a 
certain fashion with the Son of God in his redemptive work. He shows himself to be a disciple of 
Christ by carrying the cross, daily, in the work he is called to accomplish.^ Work can be a means 
of sanctification and a way of animating earthly realities with the Spirit of Christ. ( 307 . 378 . 531 1 

2428 In work, the person exercises and fulfills in part the potential inscribed in his nature. The 
primordial value of labor stems from man himself, its author and its beneficiary. Work is for man, 
not man for work.214 (2834, 2185 1 

Everyone should be able to draw from work the means of providing for his life and that of his 
family, and of serving the human community. 

2429 Everyone has the right of economic initiative; everyone should make legitimate use of his 
talents to contribute to the abundance that will benefit all and to harvest the just fruits of his labor. 
He should seek to observe regulations issued by legitimate authority for the sake of the common 
good.^Ta 

2430 Economic life brings into play different interests, often opposed to one another. This explains 
why the conflicts that characterize it arise.^lh Efforts should be made to reduce these conflicts by 
negotiation that respects the rights and duties of each social partner: those responsible for business 
enterprises, representatives of wage-earners (for example, trade unions), and public authorities 
when appropriate. 

2431 The responsibility of the state. “Economic activity, especially the activity of a market 
economy, cannot be conducted in an institutional, juridical, or political vacuum. On the contrary, it 
presupposes sure guarantees of individual freedom and private property, as well as a stable 
currency and efficient public services. Hence the principal task of the state is to guarantee this 
security, so that those who work and produce can enjoy the fruits of their labors and thus feel 
encouraged to work efficiently and honestly.... Another task of the state is that of overseeing and 
directing the exercise of human rights in the economic sector. However, primary responsibility in 
this area belongs not to the state but to individuals and to the various groups and associations which 
make up society.”2TZ ( 1908 . 1883 1 









2432 Those responsible for business enterprises are responsible to society for the economic and 
ecological effects of their operations.^ They have an obligation to consider the good of persons 
and not only the increase of profits. Profits are necessary, however. They make possible the 
investments that ensure the future of a business and they guarantee employment. 1 2415 1 

2433 Access to employment and to professions must be open to all without unjust discrimination: 
men and women, healthy and disabled, natives and immigrants.^ For its part society should, 
according to circumstances, help citizens find work and employment.^ 

2434 A just wage is the legitimate fruit of work. To refuse or withhold it can be a grave 
injustice.^ In determining fair pay both the needs and the contributions of each person must be 
taken into account. “Remuneration for work should guarantee man the opportunity to provide a 
dignified livelihood for himself and his family on the material, social, cultural, and spiritual level, 
taking into account the role and the productivity of each, the state of the business, and the common 
good.”222 Agreement between the parties is not sufficient to justify morally the amount to be 
received in wages. 1 1867 1 

2435 Recourse to a strike is morally legitimate when it cannot be avoided, or at least when it is 
necessary to obtain a proportionate benefit. It becomes morally unacceptable when accompanied by 
violence, or when objectives are included that are not directly linked to working conditions or are 
contrary to the common good. 

2436 It is unjust not to pay the social security contributions required by legitimate authority. 
Unemployment almost always wounds its victim’s dignity and threatens the equilibrium of his 

life. Besides the harm done to him personally, it entails many risks for his family.^23 

V. Justice and Solidarity Among Nations 

2437 On the international level, inequality of resources and economic capability is such that it 
creates a real “gap” between nations. ^ On the one side there are those nations possessing and 
developing the means of growth and, on the other, those accumulating debts. (1938) 

2438 Various causes of a religious, political, economic, and financial nature today give “the social 
question a worldwide dimension.”^ There must be solidarity among nations which are already 
politically interdependent. It is even more essential when it is a question of dismantling the 
“perverse mechanisms” that impede the development of the less advanced countries.^ j n place of 
abusive if not usurious financial systems, iniquitous commercial relations among nations, and the 





arms race, there must be substituted a common effort to mobilize resources toward objectives of 
moral, cultural, and economic development, “redefining the priorities and hierarchies of values.”^ 
( 1911 . 2315) 

2439 Rich nations have a grave moral responsibility toward those which are unable to ensure the 
means of their development by themselves or have been prevented from doing so by tragic 
historical events. It is a duty in solidarity and charity; it is also an obligation in justice if the 
prosperity of the rich nations has come from resources that have not been paid for fairly. 

2440 Direct aid is an appropriate response to immediate, extraordinary needs caused by natural 
catastrophes, epidemics, and the like. But it does not suffice to repair the grave damage resulting 
from destitution or to provide a lasting solution to a country’s needs. It is also necessary to reform 
international economic and financial institutions so that they will better promote equitable 
relationships with less advanced countries.^ The efforts of poor countries working for growth and 
liberation must be supported.^ This doctrine must be applied especially in the area of agricultural 
labor. Peasants, especially in the Third World, form the overwhelming majority of the poor. 

2441 An increased sense of God and increased self-awareness are fundamental to any full 
development of human society. This development multiplies material goods and puts them at the 
service of the person and his freedom. It reduces dire poverty and economic exploitation. It makes 
for growth in respect for cultural identities and openness to the transcendent. (1908) 

2442 It is not the role of the Pastors of the Church to intervene directly in the political structuring 
and organization of social life. This task is part of the vocation of the lay faithful, acting on their 
own initiative with their fellow citizens. Social action can assume various concrete forms. It should 
always have the common good in view and be in conformity with the message of the Gospel and 
the teaching of the Church. It is the role of the laity “to animate temporal realities with Christian 
commitment, by which they show that they are witnesses and agents of peace and justice.”^! ( 899 1 

VI. Love for the Poor 2544-2547 

2443 God blesses those who come to the aid of the poor and rebukes those who turn away from 
them: “Give to him who begs from you, do not refuse him who would borrow from you”; “you 
received without pay, give without pay.”2T2 it i s by what they have done for the poor that Jesus 
Christ will recognize his chosen ones.^TJ when “the poor have the good news preached to them,” it 
is the sign of Christ’s presence.^ ( 786 . 525 . 544 . 853 1 











2444 “The Church’s love for the poor... is a part of her constant tradition.” This love is inspired by 
the Gospel of the Beatitudes, of the poverty of Jesus, and of his concern for the poor.225 Love for 
the poor is even one of the motives for the duty of working so as to “be able to give to those in 
need.”22h it extends not only to material poverty but also to the many forms of cultural and 
religious poverty.^ ( 1716 1 

2445 Love for the poor is incompatible with immoderate love of riches or their selfish use: (2536, 
2547 1 

Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches 
have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust 
will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure for the 
last days. Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by 
fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You 
have lived on the earth in luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of 
slaughter. You have condemned, you have killed the righteous man; he does not resist you.228 

2446 St. John Chrysostom vigorously recalls this: “Not to enable the poor to share in our goods is 
to steal from them and deprive them of life. The goods we possess are not ours, but theirs.”229 “The 
demands of justice must be satisfied first of all; that which is already due in justice is not to be 
offered as a gift of charity” ;24Q (2402 1 

When we attend to the needs of those in want, we give them what is theirs, not ours. More 
than performing works of mercy, we are paying a debt of justice. 241 

2447 The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his 
spiritual and bodily necessities.242 Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works 
of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. The corporal works of mercy consist 
especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and 
imprisoned, and burying the dead.243 Among all these, giving alms to the poor is one of the chief 
witnesses to fraternal charity: it is also a work of justice pleasing to God;244 ( 1460 . 1038 . 1969 . 
1004 1 

He who has two coats, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food must do 
likewise. 245 g ut gi ve f or a i ms those things which are within; and behold, everything is clean 
for you.24h if a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of you says to 
them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the 










body, what does it profit?^ 


2448 “In its various forms—material deprivation, unjust oppression, physical and psychological 
illness and death—human misery is the obvious sign of the inherited condition of frailty and need 
for salvation in which man finds himself as a consequence of original sin. This misery elicited the 
compassion of Christ the Savior, who willingly took it upon himself and identified himself with the 
least of his brethren. Hence, those who are oppressed by poverty are the object of a preferential 
love on the part of the Church which, since her origin and in spite of the failings of many of her 
members, has not ceased to work for their relief, defense, and liberation through numerous works 
of charity which remain indispensable always and everywhere.”^ (386, 1586 1 

2449 Beginning with the Old Testament, all kinds of juridical measures (the jubilee year of 
forgiveness of debts, prohibition of loans at interest and the keeping of collateral, the obligation to 
tithe, the daily payment of the day-laborer, the right to glean vines and fields) answer the 
exhortation of Deuteronomy: “For the poor will never cease out of the land; therefore I command 
you, ‘You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor in the land. ’”249 
Jesus makes these words his own: “The poor you always have with you, but you do not always 
have me.In so doing he does not soften the vehemence of former oracles against “buying the 
poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals... ,” but invites us to recognize his own presence 
in the poor who are his brethren:^ ( 1397 . 786 ) 

When her mother reproached her for caring for the poor and the sick at home, St. Rose of 

Lima said to her: “When we serve the poor and the sick, we serve Jesus. We must not fail to 

help our neighbors, because in them we serve Jesus.^2 


IN BRIEF 

2450 “You shall not steal” (Ex 20:15; Deut 5:19). “Neither thieves, nor the greedy... , nor robbers 
will inherit the kingdom of God” (1 Cor 6:10). 

2451 The seventh commandment enjoins the practice of justice and charity in the administration of 
earthly goods and the fruits of men’s labor. 

2452 The goods of creation are destined for the entire human race. The right to private property 
does not abolish the universal destination of goods. 








2453 The seventh commandment forbids theft. Theft is the usurpation of another’s goods against 
the reasonable will of the owner. 

2454 Every manner of taking and using another’s property unjustly is contrary to the seventh 
commandment. The injustice committed requires reparation. Commutative justice requires the 
restitution of stolen goods. 

2455 The moral law forbids acts which, for commercial or totalitarian purposes, lead to the 
enslavement of human beings, or to their being bought, sold or exchanged like merchandise. 

2456 The dominion granted by the Creator over the mineral, vegetable, and animal resources of the 
universe cannot be separated from respect for moral obligations, including those toward 
generations to come. 

2457 Animals are entrusted to man’s stewardship; he must show them kindness. They may be used 
to serve the just satisfaction of man’s needs. 

2458 The Church makes a judgment about economic and social matters when the fundamental 
rights of the person or the salvation of souls requires it. She is concerned with the temporal 
common good of men because they are ordered to the sovereign Good, their ultimate end. 

2459 Man is himself the author, center, and goal of all economic and social life. The decisive point 
of the social question is that goods created by God for everyone should in fact reach everyone in 
accordance with justice and with the help of charity. 

2460 The primordial value of labor stems from man himself, its author and beneficiary. By means 
of his labor man participates in the work of creation. Work united to Christ can be redemptive. 

2461 True development concerns the whole man. It is concerned with increasing each person’s 
ability to respond to his vocation and hence to God’s call (cf. CA 29). 

2462 Giving alms to the poor is a witness to fraternal charity: it is also a work of justice pleasing to 
God. 

2463 How can we not recognize Lazarus, the hungry beggar in the parable (cf. Lk 17:19-31), in the 
multitude of human beings without bread, a roof or a place to stay? How can we fail to hear Jesus: 
“As you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me” (Mt 25:45)?

ARTICLE 8 

THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT 


You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. 253 

It was said to the men of old, “You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what 
you have sworn.”254 

2464 The eighth commandment forbids misrepresenting the truth in our relations with others. This 
moral prescription flows from the vocation of the holy people to bear witness to their God who is 
the truth and wills the truth. Offenses against the truth express by word or deed a refusal to commit 
oneself to moral uprightness: they are fundamental infidelities to God and, in this sense, they 
undermine the foundations of the covenant. 

I. Living in the Truth 

2465 The Old Testament attests that God is the source of all truth. His Word is truth. His Law is 
truth. His “faithfulness endures to all generations. ”255 si nce God is “true,” the members of his 
people are called to live in the truth.256 ( 215 1 

2466 In Jesus Christ, the whole of God’s truth has been made manifest. “Full of grace and truth,” 
he came as the “light of the world,” he is the Truth .2TZ “Whoever believes in me may not remain in 





darkness.”^ The disciple of Jesus continues in his word so as to know “the truth [that] will make 
you free” and that sanctifies.^ To follow Jesus is to live in “the Spirit of truth,” whom the Father 
sends in his name and who leads “into all the truth.”2hQ To his disciples Jesus teaches the 
unconditional love of truth: “Let what you say be simply ‘Yes or No.’”2Ll [ 2153 ] 

2467 Man tends by nature toward the truth. He is obliged to honor and bear witness to it: “It is in 
accordance with their dignity that all men, because they are persons... are both impelled by their 
nature and bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth, especially religious truth. They are also 
bound to adhere to the truth once they come to know it and direct their whole lives in accordance 
with the demands of truth.”2h2 [ 2104 ] 

2468 Truth as uprightness in human action and speech is called truthfulness, sincerity, or candor. 
Truth or truthfulness is the virtue which consists in showing oneself true in deeds and truthful in 
words, and in guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy. [ 1458 ] 

2469 “Men could not live with one another if there were not mutual confidence that they were 
being truthful to one another.”^ The virtue of truth gives another his just due. Truthfulness keeps 
to the just mean between what ought to be expressed and what ought to be kept secret: it entails 
honesty and discretion. In justice, “as a matter of honor, one man owes it to another to manifest the 
truth. [ 1807 ] 

2470 The disciple of Christ consents to “live in the truth,” that is, in the simplicity of a life in 
conformity with the Lord’s example, abiding in his truth. “If we say we have fellowship with him 
while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not live according to the truth.”^ 

II. To Bear Witness to the Truth 

2471 Before Pilate, Christ proclaims that he “has come into the world, to bear witness to the 
tmth.”^h6 The Christian is not to “be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord.”2hZ i n situations that 
require witness to the faith, the Christian must profess it without equivocation, after the example of 
St. Paul before his judges. We must keep “a clear conscience toward God and toward men.”^68 
[ 1816 ] 

2472 The duty of Christians to take part in the life of the Church impels them to act as witnesses of 
the Gospel and of the obligations that flow from it. This witness is a transmission of the faith in 
words and deeds. Witness is an act of justice that establishes the truth or makes it known.^69 [ 863 . 
905 . 1807 ] 










All Christians by the example of their lives and the witness of their word, wherever they live, 
have an obligation to manifest the new man which they have put on in Baptism and to reveal 
the power of the Holy Spirit by whom they were strengthened at Confirmation.^ 

2473 Martyrdom is the supreme witness given to the truth of the faith: it means bearing witness 
even unto death. The martyr bears witness to Christ who died and rose, to whom he is united by 
charity. He bears witness to the truth of the faith and of Christian doctrine. He endures death 
through an act of fortitude. “Let me become the food of the beasts, through whom it will be given 
me to reach God.”2ZI (852, 1808, 1258 1 

2474 The Church has painstakingly collected the records of those who persevered to the end in 
witnessing to their faith. These are the acts of the Martyrs. They form the archives of truth written 
in letters of blood: (1011) 

Neither the pleasures of the world nor the kingdoms of this age will be of any use to me. It is 
better for me to die [in order to unite myself] to Christ Jesus than to reign over the ends of the 
earth. I seek him who died for us; I desire him who rose for us. My birth is approaching.... 2Z2 

I bless you for having judged me worthy from this day and this hour to be counted among your 
martyrs.... You have kept your promise, God of faithfulness and truth. For this reason and for 
everything, I praise you, I bless you, I glorify you through the eternal and heavenly High 
Priest, Jesus Christ, your beloved Son. Through him, who is with you and the Holy Spirit, may 
glory be given to you, now and in the ages to come. Amen.273 

III. Offenses Against Truth 

2475 Christ’s disciples have “put on the new man, created after the likeness of God in true 
righteousness and holiness.”^ By “putting away falsehood,” they are to “put away all malice and 
all guile and insincerity and envy and all slander.”^ 

2476 False witness and perjury. When it is made publicly, a statement contrary to the truth takes on 
a particular gravity. In court it becomes false witness.^ When it is under oath, it is perjury. Acts 
such as these contribute to condemnation of the innocent, exoneration of the guilty, or the increased 
punishment of the accused.^ They gravely compromise the exercise of justice and the fairness of 
judicial decisions. (2152 ) 


2477 Respect for the reputation of persons forbids every attitude and word likely to cause them 







unjust injury.^ He becomes guilty: 


-of rash judgment who, even tacitly, assumes as true, without sufficient foundation, the moral 
fault of a neighbor; 

-of detraction who, without objectively valid reason, discloses another’s faults and failings to 
persons who did not know them;^2 

-of calumny who, by remarks contrary to the truth, harms the reputation of others and gives 
occasion for false judgments concerning them. 

2478 To avoid rash judgment, everyone should be careful to interpret insofar as possible his 
neighbor’s thoughts, words, and deeds in a favorable way: 

Every good Christian ought to be more ready to give a favorable interpretation to another’s 
statement than to condemn it. But if he cannot do so, let him ask how the other understands it. 
And if the latter understands it badly, let the former correct him with love. If that does not 
suffice, let the Christian try all suitable ways to bring the other to a correct interpretation so 
that he may be saved.^SQ 

2479 Detraction and calumny destroy the reputation and honor of one’s neighbor. Honor is the 
social witness given to human dignity, and everyone enjoys a natural right to the honor of his name 
and reputation and to respect. Thus, detraction and calumny offend against the virtues of justice and 
charity. ( 1753 ) 

2480 Every word or attitude is forbidden which by flattery, adulation, or complaisance encourages 
and confirms another in malicious acts and perverse conduct. Adulation is a grave fault if it makes 
one an accomplice in another’s vices or grave sins. Neither the desire to be of service nor friendship 
justifies duplicitous speech. Adulation is a venial sin when it only seeks to be agreeable, to avoid 
evil, to meet a need, or to obtain legitimate advantages. 

2481 Boasting or bragging is an offense against truth. So is irony aimed at disparaging someone by 
maliciously caricaturing some aspect of his behavior. 

2482 “A lie consists in speaking a falsehood with the intention of deceiving.”^ The Lord 
denounces lying as the work of the devil: “You are of your father the devil,... there is no truth in 
him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”^2 
(392) 




2483 Lying is the most direct offense against the truth. To lie is to speak or act against the truth in 
order to lead someone into error. By injuring man’s relation to truth and to his neighbor, a lie 
offends against the fundamental relation of man and of his word to the Lord. 

2484 The gravity of a lie is measured against the nature of the truth it deforms, the circumstances, 
the intentions of the one who lies, and the harm suffered by its victims. To lie is to speak or act 
against the truth in order to lead someone into error. (1750) 

2485 By its very nature, lying is to be condemned. It is a profanation of speech, whereas the 
purpose of speech is to communicate known truth to others. The deliberate intention of leading a 
neighbor into error by saying things contrary to the truth constitutes a failure in justice and charity. 
The culpability is greater when the intention of deceiving entails the risk of deadly consequences 
for those who are led astray. (1756) 

2486 Since it violates the virtue of truthfulness, a lie does real violence to another. It affects his 
ability to know, which is a condition of every judgment and decision. It contains the seed of discord 
and all consequent evils. Lying is destructive of society; it undermines trust among men and tears 
apart the fabric of social relationships. (1607) 

2487 Every offense committed against justice and truth entails the duty of reparation, even if its 
author has been forgiven. When it is impossible publicly to make reparation for a wrong, it must be 
made secretly. If someone who has suffered harm cannot be directly compensated, he must be 
given moral satisfaction in the name of charity. This duty of reparation also concerns offenses 
against another’s reputation. This reparation, moral and sometimes material, must be evaluated in 
terms of the extent of the damage inflicted. It obliges in conscience. ( 1459 . 2412 1 

IV. Respect for the Truth 

2488 The right to the communication of the truth is not unconditional. Everyone must conform his 
life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. This requires us in concrete situations to judge whether 
or not it is appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. ( 1740 1 

2489 Charity and respect for the truth should dictate the response to every request for information 
or communication. The good and safety of others, respect for privacy, and the common good are 
sufficient reasons for being silent about what ought not be known or for making use of a discreet 
language. The duty to avoid scandal often commands strict discretion. No one is bound to reveal 
the truth to someone who does not have the right to know it.^ ( 2284 1 









2490 The secret of the sacrament of reconciliation is sacred, and cannot be violated under any 
pretext. “The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore, it is a crime for a confessor in any way to 
betray a penitent by word or in any other manner or for any reason.”^ (1467) 

2491 Professional secrets —for example, those of political office holders, soldiers, physicians, and 
lawyers—or confidential information given under the seal of secrecy must be kept, save in 
exceptional cases where keeping the secret is bound to cause very grave harm to the one who 
confided it, to the one who received it or to a third party, and where the very grave harm can be 
avoided only by divulging the truth. Even if not confided under the seal of secrecy, private 
information prejudicial to another is not to be divulged without a grave and proportionate reason. 

2492 Everyone should observe an appropriate reserve concerning persons’ private lives. Those in 
charge of communications should maintain a fair balance between the requirements of the common 
good and respect for individual rights. Interference by the media in the private lives of persons 
engaged in political or public activity is to be condemned to the extent that it infringes upon their 
privacy and freedom. (2522) 

V. The Use of the Social Communications Media 

2493 Within modern society the communications media play a major role in information, cultural 
promotion, and formation. This role is increasing, as a result of technological progress, the extent 
and diversity of the news transmitted, and the influence exercised on public opinion. 

2494 The information provided by the media is at the service of the common good.^ Society has 
a right to information based on truth, freedom, justice, and solidarity: (1906) 

The proper exercise of this right demands that the content of the communication be true and— 
within the limits set by justice and charity—complete. Further, it should be communicated 
honestly and properly. This means that in the gathering and in the publication of news, the 
moral law and the legitimate rights and dignity of man should be upheld.^ 

2495 “It is necessary that all members of society meet the demands of justice and charity in this 
domain. They should help, through the means of social communication, in the formation and 
diffusion of sound public opinion.”^ Solidarity is a consequence of genuine and right 
communication and the free circulation of ideas that further knowledge and respect for others. (906) 


2496 The means of social communication (especially the mass media) can give rise to a certain 






passivity among users, making them less than vigilant consumers of what is said or shown. Users 
should practice moderation and discipline in their approach to the mass media. They will want to 
form enlightened and correct consciences the more easily to resist unwholesome influences. (2525) 

2497 By the very nature of their profession, journalists have an obligation to serve the truth and not 
offend against charity in disseminating information. They should strive to respect, with equal care, 
the nature of the facts and the limits of critical judgment concerning individuals. They should not 
stoop to defamation. 

2498 “Civil authorities have particular responsibilities in this field because of the common good.... 
It is for the civil authority... to defend and safeguard a true and just freedom of information.”^ By 
promulgating laws and overseeing their application, public authorities should ensure that “public 
morality and social progress are not gravely endangered” through misuse of the media.^ Civil 
authorities should punish any violation of the rights of individuals to their reputation and privacy. 
They should give timely and reliable reports concerning the general good or respond to the well- 
founded concerns of the people. Nothing can justify recourse to disinformation for manipulating 
public opinion through the media. Interventions by public authority should avoid injuring the 
freedom of individuals or groups. ( 2237 . 2286 1 

2499 Moral judgment must condemn the plague of totalitarian states which systematically falsify 
the truth, exercise political control of opinion through the media, manipulate defendants and 
witnesses at public trials, and imagine that they secure their tyranny by strangling and repressing 
everything they consider “thought crimes.” ( 1903 1 

VI. Truth, Beauty, and Sacred Art 

2500 The practice of goodness is accompanied by spontaneous spiritual joy and moral beauty. 
Likewise, truth carries with it the joy and splendor of spiritual beauty. Truth is beautiful in itself. 
Truth in words, the rational expression of the knowledge of created and uncreated reality, is 
necessary to man, who is endowed with intellect. But truth can also find other complementary 
forms of human expression, above all when it is a matter of evoking what is beyond words: the 
depths of the human heart, the exaltations of the soul, the mystery of God. Even before revealing 
himself to man in words of truth, God reveals himself to him through the universal language of 
creation, the work of his Word, of his wisdom: the order and harmony of the cosmos—which both 
the child and the scientist discover — “from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a 
corresponding perception of their Creator,” “for the author of beauty created them.”29Q ( 1804 . 341 . 








2129) 


[Wisdom] is a breath of the power of God, and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; 
therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her. For she is a reflection of eternal light, a 
spotless mirror of the working of God, and an image of his goodness.^1 For [wisdom] is more 
beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she 
is found to be superior, for it is succeeded by the night, but against wisdom evil does not 
prevail .222 i became enamored of her beauty. 223 

2501 Created “in the image of God, ”224 man also expresses the truth of his relationship with God 
the Creator by the beauty of his artistic works. Indeed, art is a distinctively human form of 
expression; beyond the search for the necessities of life which is common to all living creatures, art 
is a freely given superabundance of the human being’s inner riches. Arising from talent given by 
the Creator and from man’s own effort, art is a form of practical wisdom, uniting knowledge and 
skill, 225 t0 gj ve f orm to the truth of reality in a language accessible to sight or hearing. To the 
extent that it is inspired by truth and love of beings, art bears a certain likeness to God’s activity in 
what he has created. Like any other human activity, art is not an absolute end in itself, but is 
ordered to and ennobled by the ultimate end of man.226 ( 339 ) 

2502 Sacred art is true and beautiful when its form corresponds to its particular vocation: evoking 
and glorifying, in faith and adoration, the transcendent mystery of God—the surpassing invisible 
beauty of truth and love visible in Christ, who “reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp 
of his nature,” in whom “the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily.”22Z This spiritual beauty of God 
is reflected in the most holy Virgin Mother of God, the angels, and saints. Genuine sacred art draws 
man to adoration, to prayer, and to the love of God, Creator and Savior, the Holy One and 
Sanctifier. ( 1156-1162 ) 

2503 For this reason bishops, personally or through delegates, should see to the promotion of 
sacred art, old and new, in all its forms and, with the same religious care, remove from the liturgy 
and from places of worship everything which is not in conformity with the truth of faith and the 
authentic beauty of sacred art .222 


IN BRIEF 


2504 “You shah not bear false witness against your neighbor” (Ex 20:16). Christ’s disciples have 







“put on the new man, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness” (Eph 
4:24). 


2505 Truth or truthfulness is the virtue which consists in showing oneself true in deeds and truthful 
in words, and guarding against duplicity, dissimulation, and hypocrisy. 

2506 The Christian is not to “be ashamed of testifying to our Lord” (2 Tim 1:8) in deed and word. 
Martyrdom is the supreme witness given to the truth of the faith. 

2507 Respect for the reputation and honor of persons forbids all detraction and calumny in word or 
attitude. 

2508 Lying consists in saying what is false with the intention of deceiving one’s neighbor. 

2509 An offense committed against the truth requires reparation. 

2510 The golden rule helps one discern, in concrete situations, whether or not it would be 
appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it. 

2511 “The sacramental seal is inviolable” (CIC, can. 983 § 1). Professional secrets must be kept. 
Confidences prejudicial to another are not to be divulged. 

2512 Society has a right to information based on truth, freedom, and justice. One should practice 
moderation and discipline in the use of the social communications media. 

2513 The fine arts, but above all sacred art, “of their nature are directed toward expressing in some 
way the infinite beauty of God in works made by human hands. Their dedication to the increase of 
God’s praise and of his glory is more complete, the more exclusively they are devoted to turning 
men’s minds devoutly toward God” (SC 122). 


ARTICLE 9 

THE NINTH COMMANDMENT 


You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his 
manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is your neighbor’s. 2^9 

Every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his 






heart.222 


2514 St. John distinguishes three kinds of covetousness or concupiscence: lust of the flesh, lust of 
the eyes, and pride of life. 221 In the Catholic catechetical tradition, the ninth commandment forbids 
carnal concupiscence; the tenth forbids coveting another’s goods. ( 377 . 400) 

2515 Etymologically, “concupiscence” can refer to any intense form of human desire. Christian 
theology has given it a particular meaning: the movement of the sensitive appetite contrary to the 
operation of the human reason. The apostle St. Paul identifies it with the rebellion of the “flesh” 
against the “spirit.”222 Concupiscence stems from the disobedience of the first sin. It unsettles 
man’s moral faculties and, without being in itself an offense, inclines man to commit sins. 223 (405) 

2516 Because man is a composite being, spirit and body, there already exists a certain tension in 
him; a certain struggle of tendencies between “spirit” and “flesh” develops. But in fact this struggle 
belongs to the heritage of sin. It is a consequence of sin and at the same time a confirmation of it. It 
is part of the daily experience of the spiritual battle: (362, 407) 

For the Apostle it is not a matter of despising and condemning the body which with the 
spiritual soul constitutes man’s nature and personal subjectivity. Rather, he is concerned with 
the morally good or bad works, or better, the permanent dispositions—virtues and vices— 
which are the fruit of submission (in the first case) or of resistance (in the second case) to the 
saving action of the Holy Spirit. For this reason the Apostle writes: “If we live by the Spirit, let 
us also walk by the Spirit.”224 

I. Purification of the Heart 

2517 The heart is the seat of moral personality: “Out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, 
adultery, fornication.... ”225 The struggle against carnal covetousness entails purifying the heart and 
practicing temperance: (368, 1809 ) 

Remain simple and innocent, and you will be like little children who do not know the evil that 
destroys man’s life . 222 

2518 The sixth beatitude proclaims, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”22Z 
“Pure in heart” refers to those who have attuned their intellects and wills to the demands of God’s 
holiness, chiefly in three areas: charity ;222 chastity or sexual rectitude ;222 love of truth and 
orthodoxy of faith.212 There is a connection between purity of heart, of body, and of faith: (94, 









158) 


The faithful must believe the articles of the Creed “so that by believing they may obey God, 
by obeying may live well, by living well may purify their hearts, and with pure hearts may 
understand what they believe.”^ 

2519 The “pure in heart” are promised that they will see God face to face and be like him.212 Purity 
of heart is the precondition of the vision of God. Even now it enables us to see according to God, to 
accept others as “neighbors”; it lets us perceive the human body—ours and our neighbor’s—as a 
temple of the Holy Spirit, a manifestation of divine beauty. ( 2548 . 2819 . 2501 ) 

II. The Battle for Purity 

2520 Baptism confers on its recipient the grace of purification from all sins. But the baptized must 
continue to struggle against concupiscence of the flesh and disordered desires. With God’s grace he 
will prevail (1264, 2337,1752,1762, 2846 1 

-by the virtue and gift of chastity, for chastity lets us love with upright and undivided heart; 

-by purity of intention which consists in seeking the true end of man: with simplicity of vision, 
the baptized person seeks to find and to fulfill God’s will in everything;^ 

-by purity of vision, external and internal; by discipline of feelings and imagination; by 
refusing all complicity in impure thoughts that incline us to turn aside from the path of 
God’s commandments: “Appearance arouses yearning in fools’’;^ 

-by prayer: 

I thought that continence arose from one’s own powers, which I did not recognize in myself. I 
was foolish enough not to know... that no one can be continent unless you grant it. For you 
would surely have granted it if my inner groaning had reached your ears and I with firm faith 
had cast my cares on you.^ 

2521 Purity requires modesty, an integral part of temperance. Modesty protects the intimate center 
of the person. It means refusing to unveil what should remain hidden. It is ordered to chastity to 
whose sensitivity it bears witness. It guides how one looks at others and behaves toward them in 
conformity with the dignity of persons and their solidarity. 

2522 Modesty protects the mystery of persons and their love. It encourages patience and 
moderation in loving relationships; it requires that the conditions for the definitive giving and 











commitment of man and woman to one another be fulfilled. Modesty is decency. It inspires one’s 
choice of clothing. It keeps silence or reserve where there is evident risk of unhealthy curiosity. It is 
discreet. ( 2492 ) 

2523 There is a modesty of the feelings as well as of the body. It protests, for example, against the 
voyeuristic explorations of the human body in certain advertisements, or against the solicitations of 
certain media that go too far in the exhibition of intimate things. Modesty inspires a way of life 
which makes it possible to resist the allurements of fashion and the pressures of prevailing 
ideologies. (2354) 

2524 The forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another. Everywhere, however, 
modesty exists as an intuition of the spiritual dignity proper to man. It is born with the awakening 
consciousness of being a subject. Teaching modesty to children and adolescents means awakening 
in them respect for the human person. 

2525 Christian purity requires a purification of the social climate. It requires of the 
communications media that their presentations show concern for respect and restraint. Purity of 
heart brings freedom from widespread eroticism and avoids entertainment inclined to voyeurism 
and illusion. (2344 ) 

2526 So-called moral permissiveness rests on an erroneous conception of human freedom; the 
necessary precondition for the development of true freedom is to let oneself be educated in the 
moral law. Those in charge of education can reasonably be expected to give young people 
instruction respectful of the truth, the qualities of the heart, and the moral and spiritual dignity of 
man. (1740) 

2527 “The Good News of Christ continually renews the life and culture of fallen man; it combats 
and removes the error and evil which flow from the ever-present attraction of sin. It never ceases to 
purify and elevate the morality of peoples. It takes the spiritual qualities and endowments of every 
age and nation, and with supernatural riches it causes them to blossom, as it were, from within; it 
fortifies, completes, and restores them in Christ.”^ (1204) 


IN BRIEF 


2528 “Everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his 









heart” (Mt 5:28). 


2529 The ninth commandment warns against lust or carnal concupiscence. 

2530 The struggle against carnal lust involves purifying the heart and practicing temperance. 

2531 Purity of heart will enable us to see God: it enables us even now to see things according to 
God. 

2532 Purification of the heart demands prayer, the practice of chastity, purity of intention and of 
vision. 

2533 Purity of heart requires the modesty which is patience, decency, and discretion. Modesty 
protects the intimate center of the person. 


ARTICLE 10 

THE TENTH COMMANDMENT 


You shall not covet... anything that is your neighbor’s.... You shall not desire your neighbor’s 
house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is 
your neighbor’s.^ 

For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.^ 

2534 The tenth commandment unfolds and completes the ninth, which is concerned with 
concupiscence of the flesh. It forbids coveting the goods of another, as the root of theft, robbery, 
and fraud, which the seventh commandment forbids. “Lust of the eyes” leads to the violence and 
injustice forbidden by the fifth commandment.^ Avarice, like fornication, originates in the 
idolatry prohibited by the first three prescriptions of the Law.^20 The tenth commandment concerns 
the intentions of the heart; with the ninth, it summarizes all the precepts of the Law. 1 2112 . 2069 1 

I. The Disorder of Covetous Desires 

2535 The sensitive appetite leads us to desire pleasant things we do not have, e.g., the desire to eat 
when we are hungry or to warm ourselves when we are cold. These desires are good in themselves; 
but often they exceed the limits of reason and drive us to covet unjustly what is not ours and 









belongs to another or is owed to him. (1767) 


2536 The tenth commandment forbids greed and the desire to amass earthly goods without limit. It 
forbids avarice arising from a passion for riches and their attendant power. It also forbids the desire 
to commit injustice by harming our neighbor in his temporal goods: ( 2445 ) 

When the Law says, “You shall not covet,” these words mean that we should banish our 
desires for whatever does not belong to us. Our thirst for another’s goods is immense, infinite, 
never quenched. Thus it is written: “He who loves money never has money enough. ”221 

2537 It is not a violation of this commandment to desire to obtain things that belong to one’s 
neighbor, provided this is done by just means. Traditional catechesis realistically mentions “those 
who have a harder struggle against their criminal desires” and so who “must be urged the more to 
keep this commandment”: 

...merchants who desire scarcity and rising prices, who cannot bear not to be the only ones 
buying and selling so that they themselves can sell more dearly and buy more cheaply; those 
who hope that their peers will be impoverished, in order to realize a profit either by selling to 
them or buying from them... physicians who wish disease to spread; lawyers who are eager for 
many important cases and trials.222 

2538 The tenth commandment requires that envy be banished from the human heart. When the 
prophet Nathan wanted to spur King David to repentance, he told him the story about the poor man 
who had only one ewe lamb that he treated like his own daughter and the rich man who, despite the 
great number of his flocks, envied the poor man and ended by stealing his lamb. 222 Envy can lead 
to the worst crimes.224 “Through the devil’s envy death entered the world”;222 ( 2317 . 391 1 

We fight one another, and envy arms us against one another.... If everyone strives to unsettle 
the Body of Christ, where shall we end up? We are engaged in making Christ’s Body a 
corpse.... We declare ourselves members of one and the same organism, yet we devour one 
another like beasts. 22h 

2539 Envy is a capital sin. It refers to the sadness at the sight of another’s goods and the 
immoderate desire to acquire them for oneself, even unjustly. When it wishes grave harm to a 
neighbor it is a mortal sin: ( 1866 ) 


St. Augustine saw envy as “the diabolical sin.”22Z “From envy are born hatred, detraction, 







calumny, joy caused by the misfortune of a neighbor, and displeasure caused by his 

prosperity. ”22£ 


2540 Envy represents a form of sadness and therefore a refusal of charity; the baptized person 
should struggle against it by exercising good will. Envy often comes from pride; the baptized 
person should train himself to live in humility: (1829) 

Would you like to see God glorified by you? Then rejoice in your brother’s progress and you 
will immediately give glory to God. Because his servant could conquer envy by rejoicing in 
the merits of others, God will be praised.229 

II. The Desires of the Spirit 

2541 The economy of law and grace turns men’s hearts away from avarice and envy. It initiates 
them into desire for the Sovereign Good; it instructs them in the desires of the Holy Spirit who 
satisfies man’s heart. f !718 . 2764 . 397 ) 

The God of the promises always warned man against seduction by what from the beginning 
has seemed “good for food... a delight to the eyes... to be desired to make one wise. ”220 

2542 The Law entrusted to Israel never sufficed to justify those subject to it; it even became the 
instrument of “lust.”22i The gap between wanting and doing points to the conflict between God’s 
Law which is the “law of my mind,” and another law “making me captive to the law of sin which 
dwells in my members. ”222 (1963) 

2543 “But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law, although the law and 
the prophets bear witness to it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who 
believe. ”223 Henceforth, Christ’s faithful “have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires”; 
they are led by the Spirit and follow the desires of the Spirit.224 ( 1992 ) 

III. Poverty of Heart 2443-2449 

2544 Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them “renounce 
all that [they have]” for his sake and that of the Gospel.223 Shortly before his passion he gave them 
the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live 
on.226 xhe precept of detachment from riches is obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of 
heaven. 1 544 ] 










2545 All Christ’s faithful are to “direct their affections rightly, lest they be hindered in their pursuit 
of perfect charity by the use of worldly things and by an adherence to riches which is contrary to 
the spirit of evangelical poverty. ”22Z ( 2013 1 

2546 “Blessed are the poor in spirit.”^ The Beatitudes reveal an order of happiness and grace, of 
beauty and peace. Jesus celebrates the joy of the poor, to whom the Kingdom already belongs:^ 
1 1716 1 

The Word speaks of voluntary humility as “poverty in spirit”; the Apostle gives an example of 
God’s poverty when he says: “For your sakes he became poor.”24Q 

2547 The Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their consolation in the abundance of 
goods. 241 «L et the proud seek and love earthly kingdoms, but blessed are the poor in spirit for 
theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.”242 Abandonment to the providence of the Father in heaven frees 
us from anxiety about tomorrow.^ Trust in God is a preparation for the blessedness of the poor. 
They shall see God. 1 305 1 

IV. “I Want to See God” 

2548 Desire for true happiness frees man from his immoderate attachment to the goods of this 
world so that he can find his fulfillment in the vision and beatitude of God. “The promise [of seeing 
God] surpasses all beatitude.... In Scripture, to see is to possess.... Whoever sees God has obtained 
all the goods of which he can conceive. ”244 1 2519 1 

2549 It remains for the holy people to struggle, with grace from on high, to obtain the good things 
God promises. In order to possess and contemplate God, Christ’s faithful mortify their cravings 
and, with the grace of God, prevail over the seductions of pleasure and power. 1 2015 1 

2550 On this way of perfection, the Spirit and the Bride call whoever hears them245 to perfect 
communion with God: 1 314 1 

There will true glory be, where no one will be praised by mistake or flattery; true honor will 
not be refused to the worthy, nor granted to the unworthy; likewise, no one unworthy will 
pretend to be worthy, where only those who are worthy will be admitted. There true peace will 
reign, where no one will experience opposition either from self or others. God himself will be 
virtue’s reward; he gives virtue and has promised to give himself as the best and greatest 
reward that could exist....” I shall be their God and they will be my people....” This is also the 








meaning of the Apostle’s words: “So that God may be all in all.” God himself will be the goal 
of our desires; we shall contemplate him without end, love him without surfeit, praise him 
without weariness. This gift, this state, this act, like eternal life itself, will assuredly be 
common to all. 246 


IN BRIEF 

2551 “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also” (Mt 6:21). 

2552 The tenth commandment forbids avarice arising from a passion for riches and their attendant 
power. 

2553 Envy is sadness at the sight of another’s goods and the immoderate desire to have them for 
oneself. It is a capital sin. 

2554 The baptized person combats envy through good-will, humility, and abandonment to the 
providence of God. 

2555 Christ’s faithful “have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires” (Gal 5:24); they are 
led by the Spirit and follow his desires. 

2556 Detachment from riches is necessary for entering the Kingdom of heaven. “Blessed are the 
poor in spirit.” 

2557 “I want to see God” expresses the true desire of man. Thirst for God is quenched by the water 
of eternal life (cf. Jn 4:14).

PART FOUR 
CHRISTIAN PRAYER 



SECTION ONE 

PRAYER IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE 


2558 “Great is the mystery of the faith!” The Church professes this mystery in the Apostles’ Creed 
(Part One ) and celebrates it in the sacramental liturgy (Part Two), so that the life of the faithful 
may be conformed to Christ in the Holy Spirit to the glory of God the Father (Part Three). This 
mystery, then, requires that the faithful believe in it, that they celebrate it, and that they live from it 
in a vital and personal relationship with the living and true God. This relationship is prayer. 

WHAT IS PRAYER? 

For me, prayer is a surge of the heart; it is a simple look turned toward heaven, it is a cry of 
recognition and of love, embracing both trial and joy.i 

Prayer as God’s gift 

2559 “Prayer is the raising of one’s mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from 
God.”^ But when we pray, do we speak from the height of our pride and will, or “out of the depths” 
of a humble and contrite heart?^ He who humbles himself will be exalted;^ humility is the 
foundation of prayer. Only when we humbly acknowledge that “we do not know how to pray as we 
ought,are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer. “Man is a beggar before God.”§ (2613 . 
2763 1 

2560 “If you knew the gift of God!”2 The wonder of prayer is revealed beside the well where we 
come seeking water: there, Christ comes to meet every human being. It is he who first seeks us and 
asks us for a drink. Jesus thirsts; his asking arises from the depths of God’s desire for us. Whether 
we realize it or not, prayer is the encounter of God’s thirst with ours. God thirsts that we may thirst 
for him.S 

2561 “You would have asked him, and he would have given you living water. ”2 Paradoxically our 
prayer of petition is a response to the plea of the living God: “They have forsaken me, the fountain 
of living waters, and hewn out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water !”i2 
Prayer is the response of faith to the free promise of salvation and also a response of love to the 
thirst of the only Son of God.ii 


Prayer as covenant 




2562 Where does prayer come from? Whether prayer is expressed in words or gestures, it is the 
whole man who prays. But in naming the source of prayer, Scripture speaks sometimes of the soul 
or the spirit, but most often of the heart (more than a thousand times). According to Scripture, it is 
the heart that prays. If our heart is far from God, the words of prayer are in vain. 

2563 The heart is the dwelling-place where I am, where I live; according to the Semitic or Biblical 
expression, the heart is the place “to which I withdraw.” The heart is our hidden center, beyond the 
grasp of our reason and of others; only the Spirit of God can fathom the human heart and know it 
fully. The heart is the place of decision, deeper than our psychic drives. It is the place of truth, 
where we choose life or death. It is the place of encounter, because as image of God we live in 
relation: it is the place of covenant. 1 2699 . 1696 1 

2564 Christian prayer is a covenant relationship between God and man in Christ. It is the action of 
God and of man, springing forth from both the Holy Spirit and ourselves, wholly directed to the 
Father, in union with the human will of the Son of God made man. 

Prayer as communion 

2565 In the New Covenant, prayer is the living relationship of the children of God with their Father 
who is good beyond measure, with his Son Jesus Christ and with the Holy Spirit. The grace of the 
Kingdom is “the union of the entire holy and royal Trinity... with the whole human spirit.”^ Thus, 
the life of prayer is the habit of being in the presence of the thrice-holy God and in communion 
with him. This communion of life is always possible because, through Baptism, we have already 
been united with Christ.^ Prayer is Christian insofar as it is communion with Christ and extends 
throughout the Church, which is his Body. Its dimensions are those of Christ’s love. 14 (260, 792 1

CHAPTER ONE 

THE REVELATION OF PRAYER 


THE UNIVERSAL CALL TO PRAYER 

2566 Man is in search of God. In the act of creation, God calls every being from nothingness into 
existence. “Crowned with glory and honor,” man is, after the angels, capable of acknowledging 
“how majestic is the name of the Lord in all the earth.”l Even after losing through his sin his 
likeness to God, man remains an image of his Creator, and retains the desire for the one who calls 
him into existence. All religions bear witness to men’s essential search for God.2 (296, 355, 28) 

2567 God calls man first Man may forget his Creator or hide far from his face; he may run after 
idols or accuse the deity of having abandoned him; yet the living and true God tirelessly calls each 
person to that mysterious encounter known as prayer. In prayer, the faithful God’s initiative of love 
always comes first; our own first step is always a response. As God gradually reveals himself and 
reveals man to himself, prayer appears as a reciprocal call, a covenant drama. Through words and 
actions, this drama engages the heart. It unfolds throughout the whole history of salvation. (30, 
142 1 

ARTICLE 1 

IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 


2568 In the Old Testament, the revelation of prayer comes between the fall and the restoration of 
man, that is, between God’s sorrowful call to his first children: “Where are you?... What is this that 
you have done?”^ and the response of God’s only Son on coming into the world: “Lo, I have come 
to do your will, O God. ”4 Prayer is bound up with human history, for it is the relationship with God 
in historical events. (410, 1736 . 2738 ) 

Creation—source of prayer 

2569 Prayer is lived in the first place beginning with the realities of creation. The first nine 
chapters of Genesis describe this relationship with God as an offering of the first-born of Abel’s 
flock, as the invocation of the divine name at the time of Enosh, and as “walking with God.”- 
Noah’s offering is pleasing to God, who blesses him and through him all creation, because his heart 
was upright and undivided; Noah, like Enoch before him, “walks with God.”§ This kind of prayer is 










lived by many righteous people in all religions. (288, 58, 59) 

In his indefectible covenant with every living creature,! God has always called people to 
prayer. But it is above all beginning with our father Abraham that prayer is revealed in the Old 
Testament. 

God’s promise and the prayer of Faith 

2570 When God calls him, Abraham goes forth “as the Lord had told him”;^ Abraham’s heart is 
entirely submissive to the Word and so he obeys. Such attentiveness of the heart, whose decisions 
are made according to God’s will, is essential to prayer, while the words used count only in relation 
to it. Abraham’s prayer is expressed first by deeds: a man of silence, he constructs an altar to the 
Lord at each stage of his journey. Only later does Abraham’s first prayer in words appear: a veiled 
complaint reminding God of his promises which seem unfulfilled.^ Thus one aspect of the drama of 
prayer appears from the beginning: the test of faith in the fidelity of God. ( 145 ) 

2571 Because Abraham believed in God and walked in his presence and in covenant with him,!^ 
the patriarch is ready to welcome a mysterious Guest into his tent. Abraham’s remarkable 
hospitality at Mamre foreshadows the annunciation of the true Son of the promise.!! After that, 
once God had confided his plan, Abraham’s heart is attuned to his Lord’s compassion for men and 
he dares to intercede for them with bold confidence.!! (494, 2635 1 

2572 As a final stage in the purification of his faith, Abraham, “who had received the promises,”!! 
is asked to sacrifice the son God had given him. Abraham’s faith does not weaken (“God himself 
will provide the lamb for a burnt offering.”), for he “considered that God was able to raise men 
even from the dead. ”14 And so the father of believers is conformed to the likeness of the Father 
who will not spare his own Son but will deliver him up for us all.!! Prayer restores man to God’s 
likeness and enables him to share in the power of God’s love that saves the multitude.!! (603) 

2573 God renews his promise to Jacob, the ancestor of the twelve tribes of Israel. H Before 
confronting his elder brother Esau, Jacob wrestles all night with a mysterious figure who refuses to 
reveal his name, but who blesses him before leaving him at dawn. From this account, the spiritual 
tradition of the Church has retained the symbol of prayer as a battle of faith and as the triumph of 
perseverance.!! ( 162 1 

Moses and the prayer of the mediator 


2574 Once the promise begins to be fulfilled (Passover, the Exodus, the gift of the Law, and the 








ratification of the covenant), the prayer of Moses becomes the most striking example of 
intercessory prayer, which will be fulfilled in “the one mediator between God and men, the man 
Christ Jesus. ”22 (62) 

2575 Here again the initiative is God’s. From the midst of the burning bush he calls Moses. 20 This 
event will remain one of the primordial images of prayer in the spiritual tradition of Jews and 
Christians alike. When “the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob” calls Moses to be his servant, 
it is because he is the living God who wants men to live. God reveals himself in order to save them, 
though he does not do this alone or despite them: he calls Moses to be his messenger, an associate 
in his compassion, his work of salvation. There is something of a divine plea in this mission, and 
only after long debate does Moses attune his own will to that of the Savior God. But in the dialogue 
in which God confides in him, Moses also learns how to pray: he balks, makes excuses, above all 
questions: and it is in response to his question that the Lord confides his ineffable name, which will 
be revealed through his mighty deeds. (205) 

2576 “Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.”21 
Moses’ prayer is characteristic of contemplative prayer by which God’s servant remains faithful to 
his mission. Moses converses with God often and at length, climbing the mountain to hear and 
entreat him and coming down to the people to repeat the words of his God for their guidance. 
Moses “is entrusted with all my house. With him I speak face to face, clearly, not in riddles,” for 
“Moses was very humble, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth. ”22 ( 555 ) 

2577 From this intimacy with the faithful God, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, 22 
Moses drew strength and determination for his intercession. He does not pray for himself but for 
the people whom God made his own. Moses already intercedes for them during the battle with the 
Amalekites and prays to obtain healing for Miriam.24 But it is chiefly after their apostasy that 
Moses “stands in the breach” before God in order to save the people. 22 The arguments of his prayer 
—for intercession is also a mysterious battle—will inspire the boldness of the great intercessors 
among the Jewish people and in the Church: God is love; he is therefore righteous and faithful; he 
cannot contradict himself; he must remember his marvellous deeds, since his glory is at stake, and 
he cannot forsake this people that bears his name. (210, 2635 . 214 ) 

David and the prayer of the king 

2578 The prayer of the People of God flourishes in the shadow of God’s dwelling place, first the 
ark of the covenant and later the Temple. At first the leaders of the people—the shepherds and the 









prophets—teach them to pray. The infant Samuel must have learned from his mother Hannah how 
“to stand before the LORD” and from the priest Eli how to listen to his word: “Speak, LORD, for 
your servant is listening.”^ Later, he will also know the cost and consequence of intercession: 
“Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for 
you; and I will instruct you in the good and the right way.”^Z 

2579 David is par excellence the king “after God’s own heart,” the shepherd who prays for his 
people and prays in their name. His submission to the will of God, his praise, and his repentance, 
will be a model for the prayer of the people. His prayer, the prayer of God’s Anointed, is a faithful 
adherence to the divine promise and expresses a loving and joyful trust in God, the only King and 
Lord.^ In the Psalms David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, is the first prophet of Jewish and Christian 
prayer. The prayer of Christ, the true Messiah and Son of David, will reveal and fulfill the meaning 
of this prayer. (709, 436) 

2580 The Temple of Jerusalem, the house of prayer that David wanted to build, will be the work of 
his son, Solomon. The prayer at the dedication of the Temple relies on God’s promise and 
covenant, on the active presence of his name among his People, recalling his mighty deeds at the 
Exodus.^ The king lifts his hands toward heaven and begs the Lord, on his own behalf, on behalf 
of the entire people, and of the generations yet to come, for the forgiveness of their sins and for 
their daily needs, so that the nations may know that He is the only God and that the heart of his 
people may belong wholly and entirely to him. ( 583 ) 

Elijah, the prophets and conversion of heart 

2581 For the People of God, the Temple was to be the place of their education in prayer: 
pilgrimages, feasts and sacrifices, the evening offering, the incense, and the bread of the Presence 
(“shewbread”)—all these signs of the holiness and glory of God Most High and Most Near were 
appeals to and ways of prayer. But ritualism often encouraged an excessively external worship. The 
people needed education in faith and conversion of heart; this was the mission of the prophets, both 
before and after the Exile. (1150) 

2582 Elijah is the “father” of the prophets, “the generation of those who seek him, who seek the 
face of the God of Jacob. ”22 Elijah’s name, “The Lord is my God,” foretells the people’s cry in 
response to his prayer on Mount Carmel.2i St. James refers to Elijah in order to encourage us to 
pray: “The prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective. ”22 


2583 After Elijah had learned mercy during his retreat at the Wadi Cherith, he teaches the widow of 






Zarephath to believe in The Word of God and confirms her faith by his urgent prayer: God brings 
the widow’s child back to life.23 (696, 555) 

The sacrifice on Mount Carmel is a decisive test for the faith of the People of God. In response 
to Elijah’s plea, “Answer me, O LORD, answer me,” the Lord’s fire consumes the holocaust, at the 
time of the evening oblation. The Eastern liturgies repeat Elijah’s plea in the Eucharistic epiclesis. 

Finally, taking the desert road that leads to the place where the living and true God reveals 
himself to his people, Elijah, like Moses before him, hides “in a cleft of the rock” until the 
mysterious presence of God has passed by .24 But only on the mountain of the Transfiguration will 
Moses and Elijah behold the unveiled face of him whom they sought; “the light of the knowledge 
of the glory of God [shines] in the face of Christ,” crucified and risen.25 

2584 In their “one to one” encounters with God, the prophets draw light and strength for their 
mission. Their prayer is not flight from this unfaithful world, but rather attentiveness to The Word 
of God. At times their prayer is an argument or a complaint, but it is always an intercession that 
awaits and prepares for the intervention of the Savior God, the Lord of history.^ [ 2709 1 

The Psalms, the prayer of the assembly 

2585 From the time of David to the coming of the Messiah texts appearing in these sacred books 
show a deepening in prayer for oneself and in prayer for others.22 Thus the psalms were gradually 
collected into the five books of the Psalter (or “Praises”), the masterwork of prayer in the Old 
Testament. [ 1093 1 

2586 The Psalms both nourished and expressed the prayer of the People of God gathered during the 
great feasts at Jerusalem and each Sabbath in the synagogues. Their prayer is inseparably personal 
and communal; it concerns both those who are praying and all men. The Psalms arose from the 
communities of the Holy Land and the Diaspora, but embrace all creation. Their prayer recalls the 
saving events of the past, yet extends into the future, even to the end of history; it commemorates 
the promises God has already kept, and awaits the Messiah who will fulfill them definitively. 
Prayed by Christ and fulfilled in him, the Psalms remain essential to the prayer of the Church.2£ 
[ 1177 1 

2587 The Psalter is the book in which The Word of God becomes man’s prayer. In other books of 
the Old Testament, “the words proclaim [God’s] works and bring to light the mystery they 
contain.”22 The words of the Psalmist, sung for God, both express and acclaim the Lord’s saving 
works; the same Spirit inspires both God’s work and man’s response. Christ will unite the two. In 







him, the psalms continue to teach us how to pray. 1 2641 1 


2588 The Psalter’s many forms of prayer take shape both in the liturgy of the Temple and in the 
human heart. Whether hymns or prayers of lamentation or thanksgiving, whether individual or 
communal, whether royal chants, songs of pilgrimage or wisdom-meditations, the Psalms are a 
mirror of God’s marvelous deeds in the history of his people, as well as reflections of the human 
experiences of the Psalmist. Though a given psalm may reflect an event of the past, it still 
possesses such direct simplicity that it can be prayed in truth by men of all times and conditions. 

2589 Certain constant characteristics appear throughout the Psalms: simplicity and spontaneity of 
prayer; the desire for God himself through and with all that is good in his creation; the distraught 
situation of the believer who, in his preferential love for the Lord, is exposed to a host of enemies 
and temptations, but who waits upon what the faithful God will do, in the certitude of his love and 
in submission to his will. The prayer of the psalms is always sustained by praise; that is why the 
title of this collection as handed down to us is so fitting: “The Praises.” Collected for the 
assembly’s worship, the Psalter both sounds the call to prayer and sings the response to that call: 
Hallelu-Yah! (“Alleluia”), “Praise the Lord!” ( 304 ) 

What is more pleasing than a psalm? David expresses it well: “Praise the Lord, for a psalm is 
good: let there be praise of our God with gladness and grace!” Yes, a psalm is a blessing on 
the lips of the people, praise of God, the assembly’s homage, a general acclamation, a word 
that speaks for all, the voice of the Church, a confession of faith in song.^Q 


IN BRIEF 

2590 “Prayer is the raising of one’s mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from 
God” (St. John Damascene, De fide orth. 3, 24: PG 94, 1089C). 

2591 God tirelessly calls each person to this mysterious encounter with Himself. Prayer unfolds 
throughout the whole history of salvation as a reciprocal call between God and man. 

2592 The prayer of Abraham and Jacob is presented as a battle of faith marked by trust in God’s 
faithfulness and by certitude in the victory promised to perseverance. 

2593 The prayer of Moses responds to the living God’s initiative for the salvation of his people. It 
foreshadows the prayer of intercession of the unique mediator, Christ Jesus. 






2594 The prayer of the People of God flourished in the shadow of the dwelling place of God’s 
presence on earth, the ark of the covenant and the Temple, under the guidance of their shepherds, 
especially King David, and of the prophets. 

2595 The prophets summoned the people to conversion of heart and, while zealously seeking the 
face of God, like Elijah, they interceded for the people. 

2596 The Psalms constitute the masterwork of prayer in the Old Testament. They present two 
inseparable qualities: the personal, and the communal. They extend to all dimensions of history, 
recalling God’s promises already fulfilled and looking for the coming of the Messiah. 

2597 Prayed and fulfilled in Christ, the Psalms are an essential and permanent element of the 
prayer of the Church. They are suitable for men of every condition and time. 


ARTICLE 2 

IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME 


2598 The drama of prayer is fully revealed to us in the Word who became flesh and dwells among 
us. To seek to understand his prayer through what his witnesses proclaim to us in the Gospel is to 
approach the holy Lord Jesus as Moses approached the burning bush: first to contemplate him in 
prayer, then to hear how he teaches us to pray, in order to know how he hears our prayer. 

Jesus prays 

2599 The Son of God who became Son of the Virgin also learned to pray according to his human 
heart. He learns the formulas of prayer from his mother, who kept in her heart and meditated upon 
all the “great things” done by the Almighty.^l He learns to pray in the words and rhythms of the 
prayer of his people, in the synagogue at Nazareth and the Temple at Jerusalem. But his prayer 
springs from an otherwise secret source, as he intimates at the age of twelve: “I must be in my 
Father’s house. ”42 Here the newness of prayer in the fullness of time begins to be revealed: his 
filial prayer, which the Father awaits from his children, is finally going to be lived out by the only 
Son in his humanity, with and for men. f 470-473 . 584 . 534) 

2600 The Gospel according to St. Luke emphasizes the action of the Holy Spirit and the meaning of 
prayer in Christ’s ministry. Jesus prays before the decisive moments of his mission: before his 
Father’s witness to him during his baptism and Transfiguration, and before his own fulfillment of 









the Father’s plan of love by his Passion.^ He also prays before the decisive moments involving the 
mission of his apostles: at his election and call of the Twelve, before Peter’s confession of him as 
“the Christ of God,” and again that the faith of the chief of the Apostles may not fail when 
tempted.44 Jesus’ prayer before the events of salvation that the Father has asked him to fulfill is a 
humble and trusting commitment of his human will to the loving will of the Father. (535, 554 . 612 . 
858 . 443) 

2601 “He was praying in a certain place and when he had ceased, one of his disciples said to him, 
'Lord, teach us to pray. ’”45 In seeing the Master at prayer the disciple of Christ also wants to pray. 
By contemplating and hearing the Son, the master of prayer, the children learn to pray to the Father. 
(2765) 

2602 Jesus often draws apart to pray in solitude, on a mountain, preferably at night.4£ He includes 
all men in his prayer, for he has taken on humanity in his incarnation, and he offers them to the 
Father when he offers himself. Jesus, the Word who has become flesh, shares by his human prayer 
in all that “his brethren” experience; he sympathizes with their weaknesses in order to free them.4Z 
It was for this that the Father sent him. His words and works are the visible manifestation of his 
prayer in secret. ( 616 1 

2603 The evangelists have preserved two more explicit prayers offered by Christ during his public 
ministry. Each begins with thanksgiving. In the first, Jesus confesses the Father, acknowledges, and 
blesses him because he has hidden the mysteries of the Kingdom from those who think themselves 
learned and has revealed them to infants, the poor of the Beatitudes. 45 His exclamation, “Yes, 
Father!” expresses the depth of his heart, his adherence to the Father’s “good pleasure,” echoing his 
mother’s Fiat at the time of his conception and prefiguring what he will say to the Father in his 
agony. The whole prayer of Jesus is contained in this loving adherence of his human heart to the 
mystery of the will of the Father.^ (2673, 2546 . 494) 

2604 The second prayer, before the raising of Lazarus, is recorded by St. John.5Q Thanksgiving 
precedes the event: “Father, I thank you for having heard me,” which implies that the Father always 
hears his petitions. Jesus immediately adds: “I know that you always hear me,” which implies that 
Jesus, on his part, constantly made such petitions. Jesus’ prayer, characterized by thanksgiving, 
reveals to us how to ask: before the gift is given, Jesus commits himself to the One who in giving 
gives himself. The Giver is more precious than the gift; he is the “treasure”; in him abides his Son’s 
heart; the gift is given “as well. ”51 (478, 2746) 

The priestly prayer of Jesus holds a unique place in the economy of salvation.52 A meditation 














on it will conclude Section One. It reveals the ever present prayer of our High Priest and, at the 
same time, contains what he teaches us about our prayer to our Father, which will be developed in 
Section Two. 

2605 When the hour had come for him to fulfill the Father’s plan of love, Jesus allows a glimpse of 
the boundless depth of his filial prayer, not only before he freely delivered himself up (“Abba... not 
my will, but yours.”), S3 but even in his last words on the Cross, where prayer and the gift of self are 
but one: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do”;S4 “Truly, I say to you, today you 
will be with me in Paradise”;^ “Woman, behold your son” — “Behold your mother”;^ “I 
thirst”;3Z “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?”;3§ “It is finished”;^ “Father, into your 
hands I commit my spirit!”^ until the “loud cry” as he expires, giving up his spirit. SI (614) 

2606 All the troubles, for all time, of humanity enslaved by sin and death, all the petitions and 
intercessions of salvation history are summed up in this cry of the incarnate Word. Here the Father 
accepts them and, beyond all hope, answers them by raising his Son. Thus is fulfilled and brought 
to completion the drama of prayer in the economy of creation and salvation. The Psalter gives us 
the key to prayer in Christ. In the “today” of the Resurrection the Father says: “You are my Son, 
today I have begotten you. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of 
the earth your possession.”^ ( 403 . 653 . 2587 1 

The Letter to the Hebrews expresses in dramatic terms how the prayer of Jesus accomplished 
the victory of salvation: “In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, 
with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard for 
his godly fear. Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered, and 
being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him.”§2 

Jesus teaches us how to pray 

2607 When Jesus prays he is already teaching us how to pray. His prayer to his Father is the 
theologal path (the path of faith, hope, and charity) of our prayer to God. But the Gospel also gives 
us Jesus’ explicit teaching on prayer. Like a wise teacher he takes hold of us where we are and 
leads us progressively toward the Father. Addressing the crowds following him, Jesus builds on 
what they already know of prayer from the Old Covenant and opens to them the newness of the 
coming Kingdom. Then he reveals this newness to them in parables. Finally, he will speak openly 
of the Father and the Holy Spirit to his disciples who will be the teachers of prayer in his Church. 
(520) 







2608 From the Sermon on the Mount onwards, Jesus insists on conversion of heart: reconciliation 
with one’s brother before presenting an offering on the altar, love of enemies, and prayer for 
persecutors, prayer to the Father in secret, not heaping up empty phrases, prayerful forgiveness 
from the depths of the heart, purity of heart, and seeking the Kingdom before all else. §4 This filial 
conversion is entirely directed to the Father. (541, 1430 1 

2609 Once committed to conversion, the heart learns to pray in faith. Faith is a filial adherence to 
God beyond what we feel and understand. It is possible because the beloved Son gives us access to 
the Father. He can ask us to “seek” and to “knock,” since he himself is the door and the way.^2 
( 153 . 1814 1 

2610 Just as Jesus prays to the Father and gives thanks before receiving his gifts, so he teaches us 
filial boldness: “Whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you receive it, and you will.”^ Such is 
the power of prayer and of faith that does not doubt: “all things are possible to him who 
believes.”hZ Jesus is as saddened by the “lack of faith” of his own neighbors and the “little faith” of 
his own disciples^ as he is struck with admiration at the great faith of the Roman centurion and the 
Canaanite woman.hH 1 165 1 

2611 The prayer of faith consists not only in saying “Lord, Lord,” but in disposing the heart to do 
the will of the Father.2Q Jesus calls his disciples to bring into their prayer this concern for 
cooperating with the divine plan. 1 1 2827 1 

2612 In Jesus “the Kingdom of God is at hand.”22 He calls his hearers to conversion and faith, but 
also to watchfulness. In prayer the disciple keeps watch, attentive to Him Who Is and Him Who 
Comes, in memory of his first coming in the lowliness of the flesh, and in the hope of his second 
coming in glory .23 In communion with their Master, the disciples’ prayer is a battle; only by 
keeping watch in prayer can one avoid falling into temptation.24 ( 672 . 2725 1 

2613 Three principal parables on prayer are transmitted to us by St. Luke: (546, 2559 1 
—The first, “the importunate friend,”23 

—The second, “the importunate widow,”2h is centered on one of the qualities of prayer: it is 
necessary to pray always without ceasing and with the patience 
—The third parable, “the Pharisee and the tax collector,” - concerns the humility of the heart 
that prays. “God, be merciful to me a sinner!” The Church continues to make this prayer its 
own: Kyrie eleison! 












2614 When Jesus openly entrusts to his disciples the mystery of prayer to the Father, he reveals to 
them what their prayer and ours must be, once he has returned to the Father in his glorified 
humanity. What is new is to “ask in his name .”22 Faith in the Son introduces the disciples into the 
knowledge of the Father, because Jesus is “the way, and the truth, and the life. ”22 Faith bears its 
fruit in love: it means keeping the word and the commandments of Jesus, it means abiding with him 
in the Father who, in him, so loves us that he abides with us. In this new covenant the certitude that 
our petitions will be heard is founded on the prayer of Jesus.22 (434) 

2615 Even more, what the Father gives us when our prayer is united with that of Jesus is “another 
Counselor, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.”21 This new dimension of prayer and of 
its circumstances is displayed throughout the farewell discourse. 22 In the Holy Spirit, Christian 
prayer is a communion of love with the Father, not only through Christ but also in him: “Hitherto 
you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full. ( 728 1 

Jesus hears our prayer 

2616 Prayer to Jesus is answered by him already during his ministry, through signs that anticipate 
the power of his death and Resurrection: Jesus hears the prayer of faith, expressed in words (the 
leper, Jairus, the Canaanite woman, the good thief)24 0 r in silence (the bearers of the paralytic, the 
woman with a hemorrhage who touches his clothes, the tears and ointment of the sinful woman). 22 
The urgent request of the blind men, “Have mercy on us, Son of David” or “Jesus, Son of David, 
have mercy on me!” has been renewed in the traditional prayer to Jesus known as the Jesus Prayer: 
“Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner! ”22 Healing infirmities or forgiving 
sins, Jesus always responds to a prayer offered in faith: “Your faith has made you well; go in 
peace.” (548, 2667 1 

St. Augustine wonderfully summarizes the three dimensions of Jesus’ prayer: “He prays for us 
as our priest, prays in us as our Head, and is prayed to by us as our God. Therefore let us 
acknowledge our voice in him and his in us.”22 

The prayer of the Virgin Mary 

2617 Mary’s prayer is revealed to us at the dawning of the fullness of time. Before the incarnation 
of the Son of God, and before the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, her prayer cooperates in a unique 
way with the Father’s plan of loving kindness: at the Annunciation, for Christ’s conception; at 
Pentecost, for the formation of the Church, his Body.22 In the faith of his humble handmaid, the 
Gift of God found the acceptance he had awaited from the beginning of time. She whom the 






Almighty made “full of grace” responds by offering her whole being: “Behold I am the handmaid 
of the Lord; let it be [done] to me according to your word.” “Fiat”: this is Christian prayer: to be 
wholly God’s, because he is wholly ours. (148, 494, 490 1 

2618 The Gospel reveals to us how Mary prays and intercedes in faith. At Cana, 22 the mother of 
Jesus asks her son for the needs of a wedding feast; this is the sign of another feast—that of the 
wedding of the Lamb where he gives his body and blood at the request of the Church, his Bride. It 
is at the hour of the New Covenant, at the foot of the cross, 20 that Mary is heard as the Woman, the 
new Eve, the true “Mother of all the living.” ( 2674 . 726 1 

2619 That is why the Canticle of Mary, 21 the Magnificat (Latin) or Megalynei (Byzantine) is the 
song both of the Mother of God and of the Church; the song of the Daughter of Zion and of the new 
People of God; the song of thanksgiving for the fullness of graces poured out in the economy of 
salvation and the song of the “poor” whose hope is met by the fulfillment of the promises made to 
our ancestors, “to Abraham and to his posterity for ever.” ( 724 1 


IN BRIEF 

2620 Jesus’ filial prayer is the perfect model of prayer in the New Testament. Often done in 
solitude and in secret, the prayer of Jesus involves a loving adherence to the will of the Father even 
to the Cross and an absolute confidence in being heard. 

2621 In his teaching, Jesus teaches his disciples to pray with a purified heart, with lively and 
persevering faith, with filial boldness. He calls them to vigilance and invites them to present their 
petitions to God in his name. Jesus Christ himself answers prayers addressed to him. 

2622 The prayers of the Virgin Mary, in her Fiat and Magnificat, are characterized by the generous 
offering of her whole being in faith. 


ARTICLE 3 

IN THE AGE OF THE CHURCH 


2623 On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit of the Promise was poured out on the disciples, gathered 
“together in one place. ”22 While awaiting the Spirit, “all these with one accord devoted themselves 














to prayer.”^ The Spirit who teaches the Church and recalls for her everything that Jesus said^ was 
also to form her in the life of prayer. ( 731 ) 

2624 In the first community of Jerusalem, believers “devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching 
and fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and the prayers. ”22 This sequence is characteristic of the 
Church’s prayer: founded on the apostolic faith; authenticated by charity; nourished in the 
Eucharist. (1342) 

2625 In the first place these are prayers that the faithful hear and read in the Scriptures, but also that 
they make their own—especially those of the Psalms, in view of their fulfillment in Christ.22 The 
Holy Spirit, who thus keeps the memory of Christ alive in his Church at prayer, also leads her 
toward the fullness of truth and inspires new formulations expressing the unfathomable mystery of 
Christ at work in his Church’s life, sacraments, and mission. These formulations are developed in 
the great liturgical and spiritual traditions. The forms of prayer revealed in the apostolic and 
canonical Scriptures remain normative for Christian prayer. ( 1092 . 1200 1 

I. Blessing and Adoration 

2626 Blessing expresses the basic movement of Christian prayer: it is an encounter between God 
and man. In blessing, God’s gift and man’s acceptance of it are united in dialogue with each other. 
The prayer of blessing is man’s response to God’s gifts: because God blesses, the human heart can 
in return bless the One who is the source of every blessing. 1 1078 1 

2627 Two fundamental forms express this movement: our prayer ascends in the Holy Spirit through 
Christ to the Father—we bless him for having blessed us;^ it implores the grace of the Holy Spirit 
that descends through Christ from the Father—he blesses us. ( 1083 1 

2628 Adoration is the first attitude of man acknowledging that he is a creature before his Creator. It 
exalts the greatness of the Ford who made us22 and the almighty power of the Savior who sets us 
free from evil. Adoration is homage of the spirit to the “King of Glory, ”122 respectful silence in the 
presence of the “ever greater” God.121 Adoration of the thrice-holy and sovereign God of love 
blends with humility and gives assurance to our supplications. ( 2096-2097 . 2559 1 

II. Prayer of Petition 

2629 The vocabulary of supplication in the New Testament is rich in shades of meaning: ask, 
beseech, plead, invoke, entreat, cry out, even “struggle in prayer.”122 its most usual form, because 











the most spontaneous, is petition: by prayer of petition we express awareness of our relationship 
with God. We are creatures who are not our own beginning, not the masters of adversity, not our 
own last end. We are sinners who as Christians know that we have turned away from our Father. 
Our petition is already a turning back to him. (396) 

2630 The New Testament contains scarcely any prayers of lamentation, so frequent in the Old 
Testament. In the risen Christ the Church’s petition is buoyed by hope, even if we still wait in a 
state of expectation and must be converted anew every day. Christian petition, what St. Paul calls 
“groaning,” arises from another depth, that of creation “in labor pains” and that of ourselves “as we 
wait for the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved.”iQ3 i n the end, however, 
“with sighs too deep for words” the Holy Spirit “helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how 
to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words. ”1^4 
1 2090 1 

2631 The first movement of the prayer of petition is asking forgiveness, like the tax collector in the 
parable: “God, be merciful to me a sinner!”!^ It is a prerequisite for righteous and pure prayer. A 
trusting humility brings us back into the light of communion between the Father and his Son Jesus 
Christ and with one another, so that “we receive from him whatever we ask.”l^ Asking 
forgiveness is the prerequisite for both the Eucharistic liturgy and personal prayer. (2838) 

2632 Christian petition is centered on the desire and search for the Kingdom to come, in keeping 
with the teaching of Christ.^IZ There is a hierarchy in these petitions: we pray first for the 
Kingdom, then for what is necessary to welcome it and cooperate with its coming. This 
collaboration with the mission of Christ and the Holy Spirit, which is now that of the Church, is the 
object of the prayer of the apostolic community.!^ it is the prayer of Paul, the apostle par 
excellence, which reveals to us how the divine solicitude for all the churches ought to inspire 
Christian prayer.!^ 1 By prayer every baptized person works for the coming of the Kingdom. 1 2816 . 
1942 . 2854 1 

2633 When we share in God’s saving love, we understand that every need can become the object of 
petition. Christ, who assumed all things in order to redeem all things, is glorified by what we ask 
the Father in his name.ii^ It is with this confidence that St. James and St. Paul exhort us to pray at 
all times.m 1 2830 1 


III. Prayer of Intercession 









2634 Intercession is a prayer of petition which leads us to pray as Jesus did. He is the one 
intercessor with the Father on behalf of all men, especially sinners.!^ He is “able for all time to 
save those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for 
them.”li^ The Holy Spirit “himself intercedes for us... and intercedes for the saints according to the 
will of God.”H4 (432) 

2635 Since Abraham, intercession—asking on behalf of another—has been characteristic of a heart 
attuned to God’s mercy. In the age of the Church, Christian intercession participates in Christ’s, as 
an expression of the communion of saints. In intercession, he who prays looks “not only to his own 
interests, but also to the interests of others,” even to the point of praying for those who do him 
harm. 1 2571 . 2577 1 

2636 The first Christian communities lived this form of fellowship intensely.!!^ Thus the Apostle 
Paul gives them a share in his ministry of preaching the GospehUJZ but also intercedes for them.UH 
The intercession of Christians recognizes no boundaries: “for all men, for kings and all who are in 
high positions,” for persecutors, for the salvation of those who reject the Gospel.!^ (1900, 1037 1 

IV. Prayer of Thanksgiving 

2637 Thanksgiving characterizes the prayer of the Church which, in celebrating the Eucharist, 
reveals and becomes more fully what she is. Indeed, in the work of salvation, Christ sets creation 
free from sin and death to consecrate it anew and make it return to the Father, for his glory. The 
thanksgiving of the members of the Body participates in that of their Head. (224, 1328 . 2603 1 

2638 As in the prayer of petition, every event and need can become an offering of thanksgiving. 
The letters of St. Paul often begin and end with thanksgiving, and the Lord Jesus is always present 
in it: “Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you”; 
“Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.”!^ 

V. Prayer of Praise 

2639 Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most immediately that God is God. It lauds God 
for his own sake and gives him glory, quite beyond what he does, but simply because HE IS. It 
shares in the blessed happiness of the pure of heart who love God in faith before seeing him in 
glory. By praise, the Spirit is joined to our spirits to bear witness that we are children of God, 1^1 
testifying to the only Son in whom we are adopted and by whom we glorify the Father. Praise 
embraces the other forms of prayer and carries them toward him who is its source and goal: the 










“one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist.”— (213) 


2640 St. Luke in his gospel often expresses wonder and praise at the marvels of Christ and in his 
Acts of the Apostles stresses them as actions of the Holy Spirit: the community of Jerusalem, the 
invalid healed by Peter and John, the crowd that gives glory to God for that, and the pagans of 
Pisidia who “were glad and glorified the word of God.”l^ 

2641 “[Address] one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody 
to the Lord with all your heart.”i24 Like the inspired writers of the New Testament, the first 
Christian communities read the Book of Psalms in a new way, singing in it the mystery of Christ. In 
the newness of the Spirit, they also composed hymns and canticles in the light of the unheard-of 
event that God accomplished in his Son: his Incarnation, his death which conquered death, his 
Resurrection, and Ascension to the right hand of the Father.^ Doxology, the praise of God, arises 
from this “marvelous work” of the whole economy of salvation.!^ (2587) 

2642 The Revelation of “what must soon take place,” the Apocalypse, is borne along by the songs 
of the heavenly liturgy^ but also by the intercession of the “witnesses” (martyrs).!^ The prophets 
and the saints, all those who were slain on earth for their witness to Jesus, the vast throng of those 
who, having come through the great tribulation, have gone before us into the Kingdom, all sing the 
praise and glory of him who sits on the throne, and of the Lambda i n communion with them, the 
Church on earth also sings these songs with faith in the midst of trial. By means of petition and 
intercession, faith hopes against all hope and gives thanks to the “Father of lights,” from whom 
“every perfect gift” comes down.^Q Thus faith is pure praise. ( 1137 1 

2643 The Eucharist contains and expresses all forms of prayer: it is “the pure offering” of the whole 
Body of Christ to the glory of God’s name^ and, according to the traditions of East and West, it is 
the “sacrifice of praise.” 1 1330 1 


IN BRIEF 

2644 The Holy Spirit who teaches the Church and recalls to her all that Jesus said also instructs her 
in the life of prayer, inspiring new expressions of the same basic forms of prayer: blessing, petition, 
intercession, thanksgiving, and praise. 


2645 Because God blesses the human heart, it can in return bless him who is the source of every 








blessing. 


2646 Forgiveness, the quest for the Kingdom, and every true need are objects of the prayer of 
petition. 

2647 Prayer of intercession consists in asking on behalf of another. It knows no boundaries and 
extends to one’s enemies. 

2648 Every joy and suffering, every event and need can become the matter for thanksgiving which, 
sharing in that of Christ, should fill one’s whole life: “Give thanks in all circumstances” (1 Thess 
5:18). 

2649 Prayer of praise is entirely disinterested and rises to God, lauds him, and gives him glory for 
his own sake, quite beyond what he has done, but simply because HE IS.

CHAPTER TWO 
THE TRADITION OF PRAYER 


2650 Prayer cannot be reduced to the spontaneous outpouring of interior impulse: in order to pray, 
one must have the will to pray. Nor is it enough to know what the Scriptures reveal about prayer: 
one must also learn how to pray. Through a living transmission (Sacred Tradition) within “the 
believing and praying Church,”1 the Holy Spirit teaches the children of God how to pray. (75) 

2651 The tradition of Christian prayer is one of the ways in which the tradition of faith takes shape 
and grows, especially through the contemplation and study of believers who treasure in their hearts 
the events and words of the economy of salvation, and through their profound grasp of the spiritual 
realities they experience.^ (94) 

ARTICLE 1 

AT THE WELLSPRINGS OF PRAYER 


2652 The Holy Spirit is the living water “welling up to eternal life”2 in the heart that prays. It is he 
who teaches us to accept it at its source: Christ. Indeed in the Christian life there are several 
wellsprings where Christ awaits us to enable us to drink of the Holy Spirit. ( 694 1 

The Word of God 

2653 The Church “forcefully and specially exhorts all the Christian faithful... to learn The 
surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ’ (Phil 3:8) by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures.... Let 
them remember, however, that prayer should accompany the reading of Sacred Scripture, so that a 
dialogue takes place between God and man. For ‘we speak to him when we pray; we listen to him 
when we read the divine oracles. ’”4 (133, 1100 1 

2654 The spiritual writers, paraphrasing Matthew 7:7, summarize in this way the dispositions of the 
heart nourished by the word of God in prayer: “Seek in reading and you will find in meditating; 
knock in mental prayer and it will be opened to you by contemplation.”^ 

The Liturgy of the Church 

2655 In the sacramental liturgy of the Church, the mission of Christ and of the Holy Spirit 
proclaims, makes present, and communicates the mystery of salvation, which is continued in the 







heart that prays. The spiritual writers sometimes compare the heart to an altar. Prayer internalizes 
and assimilates the liturgy during and after its celebration. Even when it is lived out “in secret, 
prayer is always prayer of the Church; it is a communion with the Holy Trinity J- ( 1073 . 368) 

The theological virtues 1812-1829 

2656 One enters into prayer as one enters into liturgy: by the narrow gate of faith. Through the 
signs of his presence, it is the Face of the Lord that we seek and desire; it is his Word that we want 
to hear and keep. 

2657 The Holy Spirit, who instructs us to celebrate the liturgy in expectation of Christ’s return, 
teaches us to pray in hope. Conversely, the prayer of the Church and personal prayer nourish hope 
in us. The psalms especially, with their concrete and varied language, teach us to fix our hope in 
God: “I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry.”2 As St. Paul prayed: 
“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy 
Spirit you may abound in hope. ”2 

2658 “Hope does not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts by the 
Holy Spirit who has been given to us. ”12 Prayer, formed by the liturgical life, draws everything into 
the love by which we are loved in Christ and which enables us to respond to him by loving as he 
has loved us. Love is the source of prayer; whoever draws from it reaches the summit of prayer. In 
the words of the Cure of Ars: 1 826 ) 

I love you, O my God, and my only desire is to love you until the last breath of my life. I love 
you, O my infinitely lovable God, and I would rather die loving you, than live without loving 
you. I love you, Lord, and the only grace I ask is to love you eternally.... My God, if my 
tongue cannot say in every moment that I love you, I want my heart to repeat it to you as often 
as I draw breath.H 

“Today” 

2659 We learn to pray at certain moments by hearing the Word of the Lord and sharing in his 
Paschal mystery, but his Spirit is offered us at all times, in the events of each day, to make prayer 
spring up from us. Jesus’ teaching about praying to our Father is in the same vein as his teaching 
about providence:!^ time is in the Father’s hands; it is in the present that we encounter him, not 
yesterday nor tomorrow, but today: “O that today you would hearken to his voice! Harden not your 
hearts. ”12 ( 1165 . 2837 . 305) 









2660 Prayer in the events of each day and each moment is one of the secrets of the kingdom 
revealed to “little children,” to the servants of Christ, to the poor of the Beatitudes. It is right and 
good to pray so that the coming of the kingdom of justice and peace may influence the march of 
history, but it is just as important to bring the help of prayer into humble, everyday situations; all 
forms of prayer can be the leaven to which the Lord compares the kingdom.14 (2546, 2632 1 


IN BRIEF 

2661 By a living transmission—Tradition—the Holy Spirit in the Church teaches the children of 
God to pray. 

2662 The Word of God, the liturgy of the Church, and the virtues of faith, hope, and charity are 
sources of prayer. 


ARTICLE 2 

THE WAY OF PRAYER 


2663 In the living tradition of prayer, each Church proposes to its faithful, according to its historic, 
social, and cultural context, a language for prayer: words, melodies, gestures, iconography. The 
Magisterium of the Church^ has the task of discerning the fidelity of these ways of praying to the 
tradition of apostolic faith; it is for pastors and catechists to explain their meaning, always in 
relation to Jesus Christ. ( 1201 ) 

Prayer to the Father 

2664 There is no other way of Christian prayer than Christ. Whether our prayer is communal or 
personal, vocal or interior, it has access to the Father only if we pray “in the name” of Jesus. The 
sacred humanity of Jesus is therefore the way by which the Holy Spirit teaches us to pray to God 
our Father. ( 2780 1 

Prayer to Jesus 

2665 The prayer of the Church, nourished by the Word of God and the celebration of the liturgy, 
teaches us to pray to the Lord Jesus. Even though her prayer is addressed above all to the Father, it 
includes in all the liturgical traditions forms of prayer addressed to Christ. Certain psalms, given 















their use in the Prayer of the Church, and the New Testament place on our lips and engrave in our 
hearts prayer to Christ in the form of invocations: Son of God, Word of God, Lord, Savior, Lamb of 
God, King, Beloved Son, Son of the Virgin, Good Shepherd, our Life, our Light, our Hope, our 
Resurrection, Friend of mankind.... ( 451 ) 

2666 But the one name that contains everything is the one that the Son of God received in his 
incarnation: JESUS. The divine name may not be spoken by human lips, but by assuming our 
humanity The Word of God hands it over to us and we can invoke it: “Jesus,” “YHWH saves. ”1^ 
The name “Jesus” contains all: God and man and the whole economy of creation and salvation. To 
pray “Jesus” is to invoke him and to call him within us. His name is the only one that contains the 
presence it signifies. Jesus is the Risen One, and whoever invokes the name of Jesus is welcoming 
the Son of God who loved him and who gave himself up for him.l^ ( 432 . 435) 

2667 This simple invocation of faith developed in the tradition of prayer under many forms in East 
and West. The most usual formulation, transmitted by the spiritual writers of the Sinai, Syria, and 
Mt. Athos, is the invocation, “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us sinners.” It 
combines the Christological hymn of Philippians 2:6-11 with the cry of the publican and the blind 
men begging for light.l^ By it the heart is opened to human wretchedness and the Savior’s mercy. 
( 2616 1 

2668 The invocation of the holy name of Jesus is the simplest way of praying always. When the 
holy name is repeated often by a humbly attentive heart, the prayer is not lost by heaping up empty 
phrases,but holds fast to the word and “brings forth fruit with patience.This prayer is possible 
“at all times” because it is not one occupation among others but the only occupation: that of loving 
God, which animates and transfigures every action in Christ Jesus. (435) 

2669 The prayer of the Church venerates and honors the Heart of Jesus just as it invokes his most 
holy name. It adores the incarnate Word and his Heart which, out of love for men, he allowed to be 
pierced by our sins. Christian prayer loves to follow the way of the cross in the Savior’s steps. The 
stations from the Praetorium to Golgotha and the tomb trace the way of Jesus, who by his holy 
Cross has redeemed the world. (478, 1674 ) 

“Come, Holy Spirit” 

2670 “No one can say 'Jesus is Lord’ except by the Holy Spirit. ”21 Every time we begin to pray to 
Jesus it is the Holy Spirit who draws us on the way of prayer by his prevenient grace. Since he 
teaches us to pray by recalling Christ, how could we not pray to the Spirit too? That is why the 









Church invites us to call upon the Holy Spirit every day, especially at the beginning and the end of 
every important action. (683, 2001 . 1310 1 


If the Spirit should not be worshiped, how can he divinize me through Baptism? If he should 
be worshiped, should he not be the object of adoration?^ 

2671 The traditional form of petition to the Holy Spirit is to invoke the Father through Christ our 
Lord to give us the Consoler Spirit.^ Jesus insists on this petition to be made in his name at the 
very moment when he promises the gift of the Spirit of Truth.24 But the simplest and most direct 
prayer is also traditional, “Come, Holy Spirit,” and every liturgical tradition has developed it in 
antiphons and hymns. 

Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful and enkindle in them the fire of your love. 2^ 

Heavenly King, Consoler Spirit, Spirit of Truth, present everywhere and filling all things, 
treasure of all good and source of all life, come dwell in us, cleanse and save us, you who are 
All-Good.-^ 

2672 The Holy Spirit, whose anointing permeates our whole being, is the interior Master of 
Christian prayer. He is the artisan of the living tradition of prayer. To be sure, there are as many 
paths of prayer as there are persons who pray, but it is the same Spirit acting in all and with all. It is 
in the communion of the Holy Spirit that Christian prayer is prayer in the Church. (695) 

In communion with the holy Mother of God 

2673 In prayer the Holy Spirit unites us to the person of the only Son, in his glorified humanity, 
through which and in which our filial prayer unites us in the Church with the Mother of Jesus.^Z 
(689) 

2674 Mary gave her consent in faith at the Annunciation and maintained it without hesitation at the 
foot of the Cross. Ever since, her motherhood has extended to the brothers and sisters of her Son 
“who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties.”^ Jesus, the only mediator, is 
the way of our prayer; Mary, his mother and ours, is wholly transparent to him: she “shows the 
way” ( hodigitria ), and is herself “the Sign” of the way, according to the traditional iconography of 
East and West. ( 494 ) 


2675 Beginning with Mary’s unique cooperation with the working of the Holy Spirit, the Churches 








developed their prayer to the holy Mother of God, centering it on the person of Christ manifested in 
his mysteries. In countless hymns and antiphons expressing this prayer, two movements usually 
alternate with one another: the first “magnifies” the Lord for the “great things” he did for his lowly 
servant and through her for all human beings;^ the second entrusts the supplications and praises of 
the children of God to the Mother of Jesus, because she now knows the humanity which, in her, the 
Son of God espoused. (970, 512, 2619 1 

2676 This twofold movement of prayer to Mary has found a privileged expression in the Ave 
Maria: (722, 490, 435, 146) 

Hail Mary [or Rejoice, Mary]: the greeting of the angel Gabriel opens this prayer. It is God 
himself who, through his angel as intermediary, greets Mary. Our prayer dares to take up this 
greeting to Mary with the regard God had for the lowliness of his humble servant and to exult in the 
joy he finds in her.22 

Full of grace, the Lord is with thee: These two phrases of the angel’s greeting shed light on 
one another. Mary is full of grace because the Lord is with her. The grace with which she is filled is 
the presence of him who is the source of all grace. “Rejoice... O Daughter of Jerusalem... the Lord 
your God is in your midst.”21 Mary, in whom the Lord himself has just made his dwelling, is the 
daughter of Zion in person, the ark of the covenant, the place where the glory of the Lord dwells. 
She is “the dwelling of God... with men.”22 Full of grace, Mary is wholly given over to him who 
has come to dwell in her and whom she is about to give to the world. 

Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. After the angel’s 
greeting, we make Elizabeth’s greeting our own. “Filled with the Holy Spirit,” Elizabeth is the first 
in the long succession of generations who have called Mary “blessed.”23 “Blessed is she who 
believed.... ”24 Mary is “blessed among women” because she believed in the fulfillment of the 
Lord’s word. Abraham, because of his faith, became a blessing for all the nations of the earth.2^ 
Mary, because of her faith, became the mother of believers, through whom all nations of the earth 
receive him who is God’s own blessing: Jesus, the “fruit of thy womb.” 

2677 Holy Mary, Mother of God: With Elizabeth we marvel, “And why is this granted me, that the 
mother of my Lord should come to me?”2b Because she gives us Jesus, her son, Mary is Mother of 
God and our mother; we can entrust all our cares and petitions to her: she prays for us as she prayed 
for herself: “Let it be to me according to your word.”27 By entrusting ourselves to her prayer, we 
abandon ourselves to the will of God together with her: “Thy will be done.” (495, 1020 1 

Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death: By asking Mary to pray for us, we 
acknowledge ourselves to be poor sinners and we address ourselves to the “Mother of Mercy,” the 
All-Holy One. We give ourselves over to her now, in the Today of our lives. And our trust 











broadens further, already at the present moment, to surrender “the hour of our death” wholly to her 
care. May she be there as she was at her son’s death on the cross. May she welcome us as our 
mother at the hour of our passing^ to lead us to her son, Jesus, in paradise. 

2678 Medieval piety in the West developed the prayer of the rosary as a popular substitute for the 
Liturgy of the Hours. In the East, the litany called the Akathistos and the Paraclesis remained 
closer to the choral office in the Byzantine churches, while the Armenian, Coptic, and Syriac 
traditions preferred popular hymns and songs to the Mother of God. But in the Ave Maria, the 
theotokia, the hymns of St. Ephrem or St. Gregory of Narek, the tradition of prayer is basically the 
same. (9Z1, 1674 1 

2679 Mary is the perfect Orans (pray-er), a figure of the Church. When we pray to her, we are 
adhering with her to the plan of the Father, who sends his Son to save all men. Like the beloved 
disciple we welcome Jesus’ mother into our homes; 12 for she has become the mother of all the 
living. We can pray with and to her. The prayer of the Church is sustained by the prayer of Mary 
and united with it in hope.42 (967, 972 1 


IN BRIEF 

2680 Prayer is primarily addressed to the Father; it can also be directed toward Jesus, particularly 
by the invocation of his holy name: “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us sinners.” 

2681 “No one can say ‘Jesus is Lord,’ except by the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor 12:3). The Church invites 
us to invoke the Holy Spirit as the interior Teacher of Christian prayer. 

2682 Because of Mary’s singular cooperation with the action of the Holy Spirit, the Church loves 
to pray in communion with the Virgin Mary, to magnify with her the great things the Lord has done 
for her, and to entrust supplications and praises to her. 


ARTICLE 3 

GUIDES FOR PRAYER 


A cloud of witnesses 

2683 The witnesses who have preceded us into the kingdom,H especially those whom the Church 














recognizes as saints, share in the living tradition of prayer by the example of their lives, the 
transmission of their writings, and their prayer today. They contemplate God, praise him and 
constantly care for those whom they have left on earth. When they entered into the joy of their 
Master, they were “put in charge of many things. ”42 Their intercession is their most exalted service 
to God’s plan. We can and should ask them to intercede for us and for the whole world. (956) 

2684 In the communion of saints, many and varied spiritualities have been developed throughout 
the history of the churches. The personal charism of some witnesses to God’s love for men has 
been handed on, like “the spirit” of Elijah to Elisha and John the Baptist, so that their followers 
may have a share in this spirit. 43 A distinct spirituality can also arise at the point of convergence of 
liturgical and theological currents, bearing witness to the integration of the faith into a particular 
human environment and its history. The different schools of Christian spirituality share in the living 
tradition of prayer and are essential guides for the faithful. In their rich diversity they are refractions 
of the one pure light of the Holy Spirit. (917, 919, 1202 1 

The Spirit is truly the dwelling of the saints and the saints are for the Spirit a place where he 
dwells as in his own home, since they offer themselves as a dwelling place for God and are 
called his temple. 44 

Servants of prayer 

2685 The Christian family is the first place of education in prayer. Based on the sacrament of 
marriage, the family is the “domestic church” where God’s children learn to pray “as the Church” 
and to persevere in prayer. For young children in particular, daily family prayer is the first witness 
of the Church’s living memory as awakened patiently by the Holy Spirit. (1657) 

2686 Ordained ministers are also responsible for the formation in prayer of their brothers and 
sisters in Christ. Servants of the Good Shepherd, they are ordained to lead the People of God to the 
living waters of prayer: the Word of God, the liturgy, the theologal life (the life of faith, hope, and 
charity), and the Today of God in concrete situations. 43 ( 1547 ) 

2687 Many religious have consecrated their whole lives to prayer. Hermits, monks, and nuns since 
the time of the desert fathers have devoted their time to praising God and interceding for his people. 
The consecrated life cannot be sustained or spread without prayer; it is one of the living sources of 
contemplation and the spiritual life of the Church. 1 916 1 


2688 The catechesis of children, young people, and adults aims at teaching them to meditate on 









The Word of God in personal prayer, practicing it in liturgical prayer, and internalizing it at all 
times in order to bear fruit in a new life. Catechesis is also a time for the discernment and education 
of popular piety.^h The memorization of basic prayers offers an essential support to the life of 
prayer, but it is important to help learners savor their meaning. (1674) 

2689 Prayer groups, indeed “schools of prayer,” are today one of the signs and one of the driving 
forces of renewal of prayer in the Church, provided they drink from authentic wellsprings of 
Christian prayer. Concern for ecclesial communion is a sign of true prayer in the Church. 

2690 The Holy Spirit gives to certain of the faithful the gifts of wisdom, faith and discernment for 
the sake of this common good which is prayer (spiritual direction ). Men and women so endowed 
are true servants of the living tradition of prayer. 

According to St. John of the Cross, the person wishing to advance toward perfection should 
“take care into whose hands he entrusts himself, for as the master is, so will the disciple be, 
and as the father is so will be the son.” And further: “In addition to being learned and discreet 
a director should be experienced.... If the spiritual director has no experience of the spiritual 
life, he will be incapable of leading into it the souls whom God is calling to it, and he will not 
even understand them.”4Z 

Places favorable for prayer 

2691 The church, the house of God, is the proper place for the liturgical prayer of the parish 
community. It is also the privileged place for adoration of the real presence of Christ in the Blessed 
Sacrament. The choice of a favorable place is not a matter of indifference for true prayer. 

—For personal prayer, this can be a “prayer corner” with the Sacred Scriptures and icons, in 
order to be there, in secret, before our Father.^ In a Christian family, this kind of little 
oratory fosters prayer in common. 

—In regions where monasteries exist, the vocation of these communities is to further the 
participation of the faithful in the Liturgy of the Hours and to provide necessary solitude 
for more intense personal prayer .43 

—Pilgrimages evoke our earthly journey toward heaven and are traditionally very special 
occasions for renewal in prayer. For pilgrims seeking living water, shrines are special 
places for living the forms of Christian prayer “in Church.” 





IN BRIEF 


2692 In prayer, the pilgrim Church is associated with that of the saints, whose intercession she 
asks. 

2693 The different schools of Christian spirituality share in the living tradition of prayer and are 
precious guides for the spiritual life. 

2694 The Christian family is the first place for education in prayer. 

2695 Ordained ministers, the consecrated life, catechesis, prayer groups, and “spiritual direction” 
ensure assistance within the Church in the practice of prayer. 

2696 The most appropriate places for prayer are personal or family oratories, monasteries, places of 
pilgrimage, and above all the church, which is the proper place for liturgical prayer for the parish 
community and the privileged place for Eucharistic adoration.

CHAPTER THREE 
THE LIFE OF PRAYER 


2697 Prayer is the life of the new heart. It ought to animate us at every moment. But we tend to 
forget him who is our life and our all. This is why the Fathers of the spiritual life in the 
Deuteronomic and prophetic traditions insist that prayer is a remembrance of God often awakened 
by the memory of the heart: “We must remember God more often than we draw breath.”! But we 
cannot pray “at all times” if we do not pray at specific times, consciously willing it. These are the 
special times of Christian prayer, both in intensity and duration. (1099) 

2698 The Tradition of the Church proposes to the faithful certain rhythms of praying intended to 
nourish continual prayer. Some are daily, such as morning and evening prayer, grace before and 
after meals, the Liturgy of the Hours. Sundays, centered on the Eucharist, are kept holy primarily 
by prayer. The cycle of the liturgical year and its great feasts are also basic rhythms of the 
Christian’s life of prayer. ( 1168 . 1174 . 2177 1 

2699 The Lord leads all persons by paths and in ways pleasing to him, and each believer responds 
according to his heart’s resolve and the personal expressions of his prayer. However, Christian 
Tradition has retained three major expressions of prayer: vocal, meditative, and contemplative. 
They have one basic trait in common: composure of heart. This vigilance in keeping the Word and 
dwelling in the presence of God makes these three expressions intense times in the life of prayer.

EXPRESSIONS OF PRAYER 


I. Vocal Prayer 

2700 Through his Word, God speaks to man. By words, mental or vocal, our prayer takes flesh. Yet 
it is most important that the heart should be present to him to whom we are speaking in prayer: 
“Whether or not our prayer is heard depends not on the number of words, but on the fervor of our 
souls. (H76) 

2701 Vocal prayer is an essential element of the Christian life. To his disciples, drawn by their 
Master’s silent prayer, Jesus teaches a vocal prayer, the Our Father. He not only prayed aloud the 











liturgical prayers of the synagogue but, as the Gospels show, he raised his voice to express his 
personal prayer, from exultant blessing of the Father to the agony of Gethsemani .2 ( 2603 . 612 ) 

2702 The need to involve the senses in interior prayer corresponds to a requirement of our human 
nature. We are body and spirit, and we experience the need to translate our feelings externally. We 
must pray with our whole being to give all power possible to our supplication. ( 1146 ) 

2703 This need also corresponds to a divine requirement. God seeks worshippers in Spirit and in 
Truth, and consequently living prayer that rises from the depths of the soul. He also wants the 
external expression that associates the body with interior prayer, for it renders him that perfect 
homage which is his due. ( 2097 ) 

2704 Because it is external and so thoroughly human, vocal prayer is the form of prayer most 
readily accessible to groups. Even interior prayer, however, cannot neglect vocal prayer. Prayer is 
internalized to the extent that we become aware of him “to whom we speak. ”4 Thus vocal prayer 
becomes an initial form of contemplative prayer. 

II. Meditation 

2705 Meditation is above all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the 
Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking. The required attentiveness 
is difficult to sustain. We are usually helped by books, and Christians do not want for them: the 
Sacred Scriptures, particularly the Gospels, holy icons, liturgical texts of the day or season, writings 
of the spiritual fathers, works of spirituality, the great book of creation, and that of history—the 
page on which the “today” of God is written. (158, 127 ) 

2706 To meditate on what we read helps us to make it our own by confronting it with ourselves. 
Here, another book is opened: the book of life. We pass from thoughts to reality. To the extent that 
we are humble and faithful, we discover in meditation the movements that stir the heart and we are 
able to discern them. It is a question of acting truthfully in order to come into the light: “Lord, what 
do you want me to do?” 

2707 There are as many and varied methods of meditation as there are spiritual masters. Christians 
owe it to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly, lest they come to resemble the 
three first kinds of soil in the parable of the sower.^ But a method is only a guide; the important 
thing is to advance, with the Holy Spirit, along the one way of prayer: Christ Jesus. ( 2690 . 2664 1 










2708 Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties 
is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and 
strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of 
Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but 
Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with 
him. (516, 2678 1 

III. Contemplative Prayer 

2709 What is contemplative prayer? St. Teresa answers: “Contemplative prayer [oracion mental] in 
my opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to 
be alone with him who we know loves us.”§ Contemplative prayer seeks him “whom my soul 
loves. ”2 It is Jesus, and in him, the Father. We seek him, because to desire him is always the 
beginning of love, and we seek him in that pure faith which causes us to be born of him and to live 
in him. In this inner prayer we can still meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself. 
1 2562-2564 1 

2710 The choice of the time and duration of the prayer arises from a determined will, revealing the 
secrets of the heart. One does not undertake contemplative prayer only when one has the time: one 
makes time for the Lord, with the firm determination not to give up, no matter what trials and 
dryness one may encounter. One cannot always meditate, but one can always enter into inner 
prayer, independently of the conditions of health, work, or emotional state. The heart is the place of 
this quest and encounter, in poverty and in faith. (2726) 

2711 Entering into contemplative prayer is like entering into the Eucharistic liturgy: we “gather 
up” the heart, recollect our whole being under the prompting of the Holy Spirit, abide in the 
dwelling place of the Lord which we are, awaken our faith in order to enter into the presence of him 
who awaits us. We let our masks fall and turn our hearts back to the Lord who loves us, so as to 
hand ourselves over to him as an offering to be purified and transformed. 1 1348 . 2100 1 

2712 Contemplative prayer is the prayer of the child of God, of the forgiven sinner who agrees to 
welcome the love by which he is loved and who wants to respond to it by loving even rnore.H But 
he knows that the love he is returning is poured out by the Spirit in his heart, for everything is grace 
from God. Contemplative prayer is the poor and humble surrender to the loving will of the Father 
in ever deeper union with his beloved Son. (2822) 









2713 Contemplative prayer is the simplest expression of the mystery of prayer. It is a gift, a grace; 
it can be accepted only in humility and poverty. Contemplative prayer is a covenant relationship 
established by God within our hearts.^ Contemplative prayer is a communion in which the Holy 
Trinity conforms man, the image of God, “to his likeness.” ( 2559 1 

2714 Contemplative prayer is also the pre-eminently intense time of prayer. In it the Father 
strengthens our inner being with power through his Spirit “that Christ may dwell in [our] hearts 
through faith” and we may be “grounded in love.”lQ 

2715 Contemplation is a gaze of faith, fixed on Jesus. “I look at him and he looks at me”: this is 
what a certain peasant of Ars in the time of his holy cure used to say while praying before the 
tabernacle. This focus on Jesus is a renunciation of self. His gaze purifies our heart; the light of the 
countenance of Jesus illumines the eyes of our heart and teaches us to see everything in the light of 
his truth and his compassion for all men. Contemplation also turns its gaze on the mysteries of the 
life of Christ. Thus it learns the “interior knowledge of our Lord,” the more to love him and follow 
him.il (521) 

2716 Contemplative prayer is hearing the Word of God. Far from being passive, such attentiveness 
is the obedience of faith, the unconditional acceptance of a servant, and the loving commitment of a 
child. It participates in the “Yes” of the Son become servant and the Fiat of God’s lowly handmaid. 
(494) 

2717 Contemplative prayer is silence, the “symbol of the world to come”!^ or “silent love. ”14 
Words in this kind of prayer are not speeches; they are like kindling that feeds the fire of love. In 
this silence, unbearable to the “outer” man, the Father speaks to us his incarnate Word, who 
suffered, died, and rose; in this silence the Spirit of adoption enables us to share in the prayer of 
Jesus. ( 533 . 498 1 

2718 Contemplative prayer is a union with the prayer of Christ insofar as it makes us participate in 
his mystery. The mystery of Christ is celebrated by the Church in the Eucharist, and the Holy Spirit 
makes it come alive in contemplative prayer so that our charity will manifest it in our acts. 

2719 Contemplative prayer is a communion of love bearing Life for the multitude, to the extent that 
it consents to abide in the night of faith. The Paschal night of the Resurrection passes through the 
night of the agony and the tomb—the three intense moments of the Hour of Jesus which his Spirit 
(and not “the flesh [which] is weak”) brings to life in prayer. We must be willing to “keep watch 
with [him] one hour. ”14 ( 165 . 2730 1 









IN BRIEF 

2720 The Church invites the faithful to regular prayer: daily prayers, the Liturgy of the Hours, 
Sunday Eucharist, the feasts of the liturgical year. 

2721 The Christian tradition comprises three major expressions of the life of prayer: vocal prayer, 
meditation, and contemplative prayer. They have in common the recollection of the heart. 

2722 Vocal prayer, founded on the union of body and soul in human nature, associates the body 
with the interior prayer of the heart, following Christ’s example of praying to his Father and 
teaching the Our Father to his disciples. 

2723 Meditation is a prayerful quest engaging thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. Its goal is 
to make our own in faith the subject considered, by confronting it with the reality of our own life. 

2724 Contemplative prayer is the simple expression of the mystery of prayer. It is a gaze of faith 
fixed on Jesus, an attentiveness to the Word of God, a silent love. It achieves real union with the 
prayer of Christ to the extent that it makes us share in his mystery. 


ARTICLE 2 

THE BATTLE OF PRAYER 


2725 Prayer is both a gift of grace and a determined response on our part. It always presupposes 
effort. The great figures of prayer of the Old Covenant before Christ, as well as the Mother of God, 
the saints, and he himself, all teach us this: prayer is a battle. Against whom? Against ourselves and 
against the wiles of the tempter who does all he can to turn man away from prayer, away from 
union with God. We pray as we live, because we live as we pray. If we do not want to act 
habitually according to the Spirit of Christ, neither can we pray habitually in his name. The 
“spiritual battle” of the Christian’s new life is inseparable from the battle of prayer. 1 2612 . 409 . 
2015 1 

I. Objections to Prayer 

2726 In the battle of prayer, we must face in ourselves and around us erroneous notions of prayer. 
Some people view prayer as a simple psychological activity, others as an effort of concentration to 











reach a mental void. Still others reduce prayer to ritual words and postures. Many Christians 
unconsciously regard prayer as an occupation that is incompatible with all the other things they 
have to do: they “don’t have the time.” Those who seek God by prayer are quickly discouraged 
because they do not know that prayer comes also from the Holy Spirit and not from themselves 
alone. (2710) 

2727 We must also face the fact that certain attitudes deriving from the mentality of “this present 
world” can penetrate our lives if we are not vigilant. For example, some would have it that only that 
is true which can be verified by reason and science; yet prayer is a mystery that overflows both our 
conscious and unconscious lives. Others overly prize production and profit; thus prayer, being 
unproductive, is useless. Still others exalt sensuality and comfort as the criteria of the true, the 
good, and the beautiful; whereas prayer, the “love of beauty” (philokalia), is caught up in the glory 
of the living and true God. Finally, some see prayer as a flight from the world in reaction against 
activism; but in fact, Christian prayer is neither an escape from reality nor a divorce from life. (37, 
2500 1 

2728 Finally, our battle has to confront what we experience as failure in prayer: discouragement 
during periods of dryness; sadness that, because we have “great possessions,”^ we have not given 
all to the Lord; disappointment over not being heard according to our own will; wounded pride, 
stiffened by the indignity that is ours as sinners; our resistance to the idea that prayer is a free and 
unmerited gift; and so forth. The conclusion is always the same: what good does it do to pray? To 
overcome these obstacles, we must battle to gain humility, trust, and perseverance. 

II. Humble Vigilance of Heart 

Facing difficulties in prayer 

2729 The habitual difficulty in prayer is distraction. It can affect words and their meaning in vocal 
prayer; it can concern, more profoundly, him to whom we are praying, in vocal prayer (liturgical or 
personal), meditation, and contemplative prayer. To set about hunting down distractions would be 
to fall into their trap, when all that is necessary is to turn back to our heart: for a distraction reveals 
to us what we are attached to, and this humble awareness before the Lord should awaken our 
preferential love for him and lead us resolutely to offer him our heart to be purified. Therein lies the 
battle, the choice of which master to served ( 2711 ) 


2730 In positive terms, the battle against the possessive and dominating self requires vigilance, 





sobriety of heart. When Jesus insists on vigilance, he always relates it to himself, to his coming on 
the last day and every day: today. The bridegroom comes in the middle of the night; the light that 
must not be extinguished is that of faith: ‘“Come,’ my heart says, ‘seek his face!”’!- ( 2659 1 

2731 Another difficulty, especially for those who sincerely want to pray, is dryness. Dryness 
belongs to contemplative prayer when the heart is separated from God, with no taste for thoughts, 
memories, and feelings, even spiritual ones. This is the moment of sheer faith clinging faithfully to 
Jesus in his agony and in his tomb. “Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains 
alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.If dryness is due to the lack of roots, because the word 
has fallen on rocky soil, the battle requires conversion.12 ( 1426 1 

Facing temptations in prayer 

2732 The most common yet most hidden temptation is our lack of faith. It expresses itself less by 
declared incredulity than by our actual preferences. When we begin to pray, a thousand labors or 
cares thought to be urgent vie for priority; once again, it is the moment of truth for the heart: what 
is its real love? Sometimes we turn to the Lord as a last resort, but do we really believe he is? 
Sometimes we enlist the Lord as an ally, but our heart remains presumptuous. In each case, our lack 
of faith reveals that we do not yet share in the disposition of a humble heart: “Apart from me, you 
can do nothing.”^ ( 2609 . 2089 . 2092 . 2074 1 

2733 Another temptation, to which presumption opens the gate, is acedia. The spiritual writers 
understand by this a form of depression due to lax ascetical practice, decreasing vigilance, 
carelessness of heart. “The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”^ The greater the height, 
the harder the fall. Painful as discouragement is, it is the reverse of presumption. The humble are 
not surprised by their distress; it leads them to trust more, to hold fast in constancy. ( 2094 . 2559 1 

III. Filial Trust 

2734 Filial trust is tested—it proves itself—in tribulation. 2? The principal difficulty concerns the 
prayer of petition, for oneself or for others in intercession. Some even stop praying because they 
think their petition is not heard. Here two questions should be asked: Why do we think our petition 
has not been heard? How is our prayer heard, how is it “efficacious”? ( 2629 1 

Why do we complain of not being heard? 


2735 In the first place, we ought to be astonished by this fact: when we praise God or give him 











thanks for his benefits in general, we are not particularly concerned whether or not our prayer is 
acceptable to him. On the other hand, we demand to see the results of our petitions. What is the 
image of God that motivates our prayer: an instrument to be used? or the Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ? 1 2779 1 

2736 Are we convinced that “we do not know how to pray as we ought”?22 Are we asking God for 
“what is good for us”? Our Father knows what we need before we ask him, 24 but he awaits our 
petition because the dignity of his children lies in their freedom. We must pray, then, with his Spirit 
of freedom, to be able truly to know what he wants. 2^ 1 2559 . 1730 1 

2737 “You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. ”2b If we 
ask with a divided heart, we are “adulterers”; 27 God cannot answer us, for he desires our well¬ 
being, our life. “Or do you suppose that it is in vain that the scripture says, ‘He yearns jealously 
over the spirit which he has made to dwell in us?’”24 That our God is “jealous” for us is the sign of 
how true his love is. If we enter into the desire of his Spirit, we shall be heard. 

Do not be troubled if you do not immediately receive from God what you ask him; for he 
desires to do something even greater for you, while you cling to him in prayer.22 

God wills that our desire should be exercised in prayer, that we may be able to receive what he 
is prepared to give.TQ 

How is our prayer? 

2738 The revelation of prayer in the economy of salvation teaches us that faith rests on God’s 
action in history. Our filial trust is enkindled by his supreme act: the Passion and Resurrection of 
his Son. Christian prayer is cooperation with his providence, his plan of love for men. 1 2568 . 307) 

2739 For St. Paul, this trust is bold, founded on the prayer of the Spirit in us and on the faithful love 
of the Father who has given us his only Son.2i Transformation of the praying heart is the first 
response to our petition. (2778) 

2740 The prayer of Jesus makes Christian prayer an efficacious petition. He is its model, he prays 
in us and with us. Since the heart of the Son seeks only what pleases the Father, how could the 
prayer of the children of adoption be centered on the gifts rather than the Giver? ( 2604 ) 


2741 Jesus also prays for us—in our place and on our behalf. All our petitions were gathered up, 









once for all, in his cry on the Cross and, in his Resurrection, heard by the Father. This is why he 
never ceases to intercede for us with the Father. 22 If our prayer is resolutely united with that of 
Jesus, in trust and boldness as children, we obtain all that we ask in his name, even more than any 
particular thing: the Holy Spirit himself, who contains all gifts. (2606, 2614 1 

IV. Persevering in Love 

2742 “Pray constantly... always and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus 
Christ to God the Father.”22 St. Paul adds, “Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and 
supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance making supplication for all the saints. ”24 
For “we have not been commanded to work, to keep watch and to fast constantly, but it has been 
laid down that we are to pray without ceasing.”22 This tireless fervor can come only from love. 
Against our dullness and laziness, the battle of prayer is that of humble, trusting, and persevering 
love. This love opens our hearts to three enlightening and life-giving facts of faith about prayer. 
(2098,162) 

2743 It is always possible to pray: The time of the Christian is that of the risen Christ who is with 
us always, no matter what tempests may arise.2§ Our time is in the hands of God: 

It is possible to offer fervent prayer even while walking in public or strolling alone, or seated 
in your shop,... while buying or selling,... or even while cooking.2Z 

2744 Prayer is a vital necessity. Proof from the contrary is no less convincing: if we do not allow 
the Spirit to lead us, we fall back into the slavery of sin.22 How can the Holy Spirit be our life if our 
heart is far from him? 

Nothing is equal to prayer; for what is impossible it makes possible, what is difficult, easy.... 
For it is impossible, utterly impossible, for the man who prays eagerly and invokes God 
ceaselessly ever to sin.22 

Those who pray are certainly saved; those who do not pray are certainly damned.— 

2745 Prayer and Christian life are inseparable, for they concern the same love and the same 
renunciation, proceeding from love; the same filial and loving conformity with the Father’s plan of 
love; the same transforming union in the Holy Spirit who conforms us more and more to Christ 
Jesus; the same love for all men, the love with which Jesus has loved us. “Whatever you ask the 
Father in my name, he [will] give it to you. This I command you, to love one another.”4i [ 2660 1 







He “prays without ceasing” who unites prayer to works and good works to prayer. Only in this 
way can we consider as realizable the principle of praying without ceasing.42 

ARTICLE 3 

THE PRAYER OF THE HOUR OF JESUS 


2746 When “his hour” came, Jesus prayed to the Father.^ His prayer, the longest transmitted by 
the Gospel, embraces the whole economy of creation and salvation, as well as his death and 
Resurrection. The prayer of the Hour of Jesus always remains his own, just as his Passover “once 
for all” remains ever present in the liturgy of his Church. (1085) 

2747 Christian Tradition rightly calls this prayer the “priestly” prayer of Jesus. It is the prayer of 
our high priest, inseparable from his sacrifice, from his passing over (Passover) to the Father to 
whom he is wholly “consecrated.”^ 

2748 In this Paschal and sacrificial prayer, everything is recapitulated in Christ:^ God and the 
world; the Word and the flesh; eternal life and time; the love that hands itself over and the sin that 
betrays it; the disciples present and those who will believe in him by their word; humiliation and 
glory. It is the prayer of unity. 1 518 . 820 1 

2749 Jesus fulfilled the work of the Father completely; his prayer, like his sacrifice, extends until 
the end of time. The prayer of this hour fills the end-times and carries them toward their 
consummation. Jesus, the Son to whom the Father has given all things, has given himself wholly 
back to the Father, yet expresses himself with a sovereign freedom^ by virtue of the power the 
Father has given him over all flesh. The Son, who made himself Servant, is Lord, the Pantocrator. 
Our high priest who prays for us is also the one who prays in us and the God who hears our prayer. 
1 2616 1 

2750 By entering into the holy name of the Lord Jesus we can accept, from within, the prayer he 
teaches us: “Our Father!” His priestly prayer fulfills, from within, the great petitions of the Lord’s 
Prayer: concern for the Father’s name;^ passionate zeal for his kingdom (glory);^ the 
accomplishment of the will of the Father, of his plan of salvation;^ and deliverance from evil.^ 
1 2815 1 


2751 Finally, in this prayer Jesus reveals and gives to us the “knowledge,” inseparably one, of the 
Father and of the Son,^i which is the very mystery of the life of prayer. ( 240 1 










IN BRIEF 

2752 Prayer presupposes an effort, a fight against ourselves and the wiles of the Tempter. The 
battle of prayer is inseparable from the necessary “spiritual battle” to act habitually according to the 
Spirit of Christ: we pray as we live, because we live as we pray. 

2753 In the battle of prayer we must confront erroneous conceptions of prayer, various currents of 
thought, and our own experience of failure. We must respond with humility, trust, and perseverance 
to these temptations which cast doubt on the usefulness or even the possibility of prayer. 

2754 The principal difficulties in the practice of prayer are distraction and dryness. The remedy lies 
in faith, conversion, and vigilance of heart. 

2755 Two frequent temptations threaten prayer: lack of faith and acedia—a form of depression 
stemming from lax ascetical practice that leads to discouragement. 

2756 Filial trust is put to the test when we feel that our prayer is not always heard. The Gospel 
invites us to ask ourselves about the conformity of our prayer to the desire of the Spirit. 

2757 “Pray constantly” (I Thess 5:17). It is always possible to pray. It is even a vital necessity. 
Prayer and Christian life are inseparable. 

2758 The prayer of the hour of Jesus, rightly called the “priestly prayer” (cf. Jn 17), sums up the 
whole economy of creation and salvation. It fulfills the great petitions of the Our Father.

SECTION TWO 
THE LORD’S PRAYER 
“OUR FATHER!” 

2759 Jesus “was praying at a certain place, and when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, 
'Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. ”’i In response to this request the Lord entrusts 
to his disciples and to his Church the fundamental Christian prayer. St. Luke presents a brief text of 
five petitions,2 while St. Matthew gives a more developed version of seven petitions.3 The 
liturgical tradition of the Church has retained St. Matthew’s text: 

Our Father who art in heaven, 
hallowed be thy name. 

Thy kingdom come. 

Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. 

Give us this day our daily bread, 

and forgive us our trespasses, 

as we forgive those who trespass against us, 

and lead us not into temptation, 

but deliver us from evil. 

2760 Very early on, liturgical usage concluded the Lord’s Prayer with a doxology. In the Didache, 
we find, “For yours are the power and the glory for ever.”4 The Apostolic Constitutions add to the 
beginning: “the kingdom,” and this is the formula retained to our day in ecumenical prayer.^ The 
Byzantine tradition adds after “the glory” the words “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.” The Roman 
Missal develops the last petition in the explicit perspective of “awaiting our blessed hope” and of 
the Second Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.^ Then comes the assembly’s acclamation or the 
repetition of the doxology from the Apostolic Constitutions. ( 2855 . 2854 1 

ARTICLE 1 

“THE SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE GOSPEL” 


2761 The Lord’s Prayer “is truly the summary of the whole gospel. ”2 “Since the Lord... after 
handing over the practice of prayer, said elsewhere, 'Ask and you will receive,’ and since everyone 
has petitions which are peculiar to his circumstances, the regular and appropriate prayer [the Lord’s 






Prayer] is said first, as the foundation of further desires. ”2 

I. At the Center of the Scriptures 

2762 After showing how the psalms are the principal food of Christian prayer and flow together in 
the petitions of the Our Father, St. Augustine concludes: 

Run through all the words of the holy prayers [in Scripture], and I do not think that you will 
find anything in them that is not contained and included in the Lord’s Prayer.^ 

2763 All the Scriptures—the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms—are fulfilled in Christ.12 The 
Gospel is this “Good News.” Its first proclamation is summarized by St. Matthew in the Sermon on 
the Mount;li the prayer to our Father is at the center of this proclamation. It is in this context that 
each petition bequeathed to us by the Lord is illuminated: (102, 2541 1 

The Lord’s Prayer is the most perfect of prayers.... In it we ask, not only for all the things we 
can rightly desire, but also in the sequence that they should be desired. This prayer not only 
teaches us to ask for things, but also in what order we should desire them.12 

2764 The Sermon on the Mount is teaching for life, the Our Father is a prayer; but in both the one 
and the other the Spirit of the Lord gives new form to our desires, those inner movements that 
animate our lives. Jesus teaches us this new life by his words; he teaches us to ask for it by our 
prayer. The rightness of our life in him will depend on the rightness of our prayer. ( 1965 . 1969 1 

II. “The Lord’s Prayer” 

2765 The traditional expression “the Lord’s Prayer” — orado Dominica —means that the prayer to 
our Father is taught and given to us by the Lord Jesus. The prayer that comes to us from Jesus is 
truly unique: it is “of the Lord.” On the one hand, in the words of this prayer the only Son gives us 
the words the Father gave him:i3 he is the master of our prayer. On the other, as Word incarnate, he 
knows in his human heart the needs of his human brothers and sisters and reveals them to us: he is 
the model of our prayer. ( 2701 ) 

2766 But Jesus does not give us a formula to repeat mechanically. J ! As in every vocal prayer, it is 
through the Word of God that the Holy Spirit teaches the children of God to pray to their Father. 
Jesus not only gives us the words of our filial prayer; at the same time he gives us the Spirit by 
whom these words become in us “spirit and life.”i^ Even more, the proof and possibility of our 







filial prayer is that the Father “sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ‘Abba! Father! ”’l^ 
Since our prayer sets forth our desires before God, it is again the Father, “he who searches the 
hearts of men,” who “knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the 
saints according to the will of God.”J^ The prayer to Our Father is inserted into the mysterious 
mission of the Son and of the Spirit. (690) 

III. The Prayer of the Church 

2767 This indivisible gift of the Lord’s words and of the Holy Spirit who gives life to them in the 
hearts of believers has been received and lived by the Church from the beginning. The first 
communities prayed the Lord’s Prayer three times a day,l£ in place of the “Eighteen Benedictions” 
customary in Jewish piety. 

2768 According to the apostolic tradition, the Lord’s Prayer is essentially rooted in liturgical 
prayer: 

[The Lord] teaches us to make prayer in common for all our brethren. For he did not say “my 
Father” who art in heaven, but “our” Father, offering petitions for the common Body.l^ 

In all the liturgical traditions, the Lord’s Prayer is an integral part of the major hours of the Divine 
Office. In the three sacraments of Christian initiation its ecclesial character is especially in 
evidence: 

2769 In Baptism and Confirmation, the handing on ( traditio ) of the Lord’s Prayer signifies new 
birth into the divine life. Since Christian prayer is our speaking to God with the very word of God, 
those who are “born anew... through the living and abiding word of God”^2 learn to invoke their 
Father by the one Word he always hears. They can henceforth do so, for the seal of the Holy 
Spirit’s anointing is indelibly placed on their hearts, ears, lips, indeed their whole filial being. This 
is why most of the patristic commentaries on the Our Father are addressed to catechumens and 
neophytes. When the Church prays the Lord’s Prayer, it is always the people made up of the “new¬ 
born” who pray and obtain mercy.^l (1243 ) 

2770 In the Eucharistic liturgy the Lord’s Prayer appears as the prayer of the whole Church and 
there reveals its full meaning and efficacy. Placed between the anaphora (the Eucharistic prayer) 
and the communion, the Lord’s Prayer sums up on the one hand all the petitions and intercessions 
expressed in the movement of the epiclesis and, on the other, knocks at the door of the Banquet of 
the kingdom which sacramental communion anticipates. (1350) 





2771 In the Eucharist, the Lord’s Prayer also reveals the eschatological character of its petitions. It 
is the proper prayer of “the end-time,” the time of salvation that began with the outpouring of the 
Holy Spirit and will be fulfilled with the Lord’s return. The petitions addressed to our Lather, as 
distinct from the prayers of the old covenant, rely on the mystery of salvation already 
accomplished, once for all, in Christ crucified and risen. ( 1403 ! 

2772 Prom this unshakeable faith springs forth the hope that sustains each of the seven petitions, 
which express the groanings of the present age, this time of patience and expectation during which 
“it does not yet appear what we shall be. ”22 The Eucharist and the Lord’s Prayer look eagerly for 
the Lord’s return, “until he comes.”22 ( 1820 1 


IN BRIEF 

2773 In response to his disciples’ request “Lord, teach us to pray” (Lk 11:1), Jesus entrusts them 
with the fundamental Christian prayer, the Our Lather. 

2774 “The Lord’s Prayer is truly the summary of the whole gospel, ”24 the “most perfect of 
prayers. ”25 It is at the center of the Scriptures. 

2775 It is called “the Lord’s Prayer” because it comes to us from the Lord Jesus, the master and 
model of our prayer. 

2776 The Lord’s Prayer is the quintessential prayer of the Church. It is an integral part of the major 
hours of the Divine Office and of the sacraments of Christian initiation: Baptism, Confirmation, 
and Eucharist. Integrated into the Eucharist it reveals the eschatological character of its petitions, 
hoping for the Lord, “until he comes” (1 Cor 11:26). 


ARTICLE 2 

“OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN” 


I. “We Dare to Say” 

2777 In the Roman liturgy, the Eucharistic assembly is invited to pray to our heavenly Lather with 
filial boldness; the Eastern liturgies develop and use similar expressions: “dare in all confidence,” 
“make us worthy of....” Prom the burning bush Moses heard a voice saying to him, “Do not come 











near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.”^ 
Only Jesus could cross that threshold of the divine holiness, for “when he had made purification for 
sins,” he brought us into the Father’s presence: “Here am I, and the children God has given me.”^ 
(270) 

Our awareness of our status as slaves would make us sink into the ground and our earthly 
condition would dissolve into dust, if the authority of our Father himself and the Spirit of his 
Son had not impelled us to this cry... ‘Abba, Father!’... When would a mortal dare call God 
‘Father,’ if man’s innermost being were not animated by power from on high?”28 

2778 This power of the Spirit who introduces us to the Lord’s Prayer is expressed in the liturgies of 
East and of West by the beautiful, characteristically Christian expression: parrhesia, 
straightforward simplicity, filial trust, joyous assurance, humble boldness, the certainty of being 
loved.29 (2828) 

II. “Father!” 

2779 Before we make our own this first exclamation of the Lord’s Prayer, we must humbly cleanse 
our hearts of certain false images drawn “from this world.” Humility makes us recognize that “no 
one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to 
whom the Son chooses to reveal him,” that is, “to little children.”2Q The purification of our hearts 
has to do with paternal or maternal images, stemming from our personal and cultural history, and 
influencing our relationship with God. God our Father transcends the categories of the created 
world. To impose our own ideas in this area “upon him” would be to fabricate idols to adore or pull 
down. To pray to the Father is to enter into his mystery as he is and as the Son has revealed him to 
us. (239) 

The expression God the Father had never been revealed to anyone. When Moses himself asked 
God who he was, he heard another name. The Father’s name has been revealed to us in the 
Son, for the name “Son” implies the new name “Father.”^ 

2780 We can invoke God as “Father” because he is revealed to us by his Son become man and 
because his Spirit makes him known to us. The personal relation of the Son to the Father is 
something that man cannot conceive of nor the angelic powers even dimly see: and yet, the Spirit of 
the Son grants a participation in that very relation to us who believe that Jesus is the Christ and that 
we are born of God. 22 ( 240 ) 






2781 When we pray to the Father, we are in communion with him and with his Son, Jesus Christ.— 
Then we know and recognize him with an ever new sense of wonder. The first phrase of the Our 
Father is a blessing of adoration before it is a supplication. For it is the glory of God that we should 
recognize him as “Father,” the true God. We give him thanks for having revealed his name to us, 
for the gift of believing in it, and for the indwelling of his Presence in us. (2665) 

2782 We can adore the Father because he has caused us to be reborn to his life by adopting us as 
his children in his only Son: by Baptism, he incorporates us into the Body of his Christ; through the 
anointing of his Spirit who flows from the head to the members, he makes us other “Christs.” 
(1267) 

God, indeed, who has predestined us to adoption as his sons, has conformed us to the glorious 
Body of Christ. So then you who have become sharers in Christ are appropriately called 
“Christs.”— 

The new man, reborn and restored to his God by grace, says first of all, “Father!” because he 
has now begun to be a son.^i? 

2783 Thus the Lord’s Prayer reveals us to ourselves at the same time that it reveals the Father to 
usM (1701) 

O man, you did not dare to raise your face to heaven, you lowered your eyes to the earth, and 
suddenly you have received the grace of Christ: all your sins have been forgiven. From being a 
wicked servant you have become a good son.... Then raise your eyes to the Father who has 
begotten you through Baptism, to the Father who has redeemed you through his Son, and say: 
“Our Father....” But do not claim any privilege. He is the Father in a special way only of 
Christ, but he is the common Father of us all, because while he has begotten only Christ, he 
has created us. Then also say by his grace, “Our Father,” so that you may merit being his 

son.^Z 


2784 The free gift of adoption requires on our part continual conversion and new life. Praying to 
our Father should develop in us two fundamental dispositions: (1428 . 1997 1 

First, the desire to become like him: though created in his image, we are restored to his 
likeness by grace; and we must respond to this grace. 

We must remember... and know that when we call God “our Father” we ought to behave as 
sons of God.^S 







You cannot call the God of all kindness your Father if you preserve a cruel and inhuman heart; 
for in this case you no longer have in you the marks of the heavenly Father’s kindness.42 

We must contemplate the beauty of the Father without ceasing and adorn our own souls 
accordingly .42 

2785 Second, a humble and trusting heart that enables us “to turn and become like children”;41 for 
it is to “little children” that the Father is revealed.42 (2562) 

[The prayer is accomplished] by the contemplation of God alone, and by the warmth of love, 
through which the soul, molded and directed to love him, speaks very familiarly to God as to 
its own Father with special devotion. 43 

Our Father: at this name love is aroused in us... and the confidence of obtaining what we are 
about to ask.... What would he not give to his children who ask, since he has already granted 
them the gift of being his children?44 

III. “Our” Father 

2786 “Our” Father refers to God. The adjective, as used by us, does not express possession, but an 
entirely new relationship with God. (443) 

2787 When we say “our” Father, we recognize first that all his promises of love announced by the 
prophets are fulfilled in the new and eternal covenant in his Christ: we have become “his” people 
and he is henceforth “our” God. This new relationship is the purely gratuitous gift of belonging to 
each other: we are to respond to “grace and truth” given us in Jesus Christ with love and 
faithfulness. 42 [ 782 ] 

2788 Since the Lord’s Prayer is that of his people in the “end-time,” this “our” also expresses the 
certitude of our hope in God’s ultimate promise: in the new Jerusalem he will say to the victor, “I 
will be his God and he shall be my son. ”42 

2789 When we pray to “our” Father, we personally address the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. By 
doing so we do not divide the Godhead, since the Father is its “source and origin,” but rather 
confess that the Son is eternally begotten by him and the Holy Spirit proceeds from him. We are 
not confusing the persons, for we confess that our communion is with the Father and his Son, Jesus 
Christ, in their one Holy Spirit. The Holy Trinity is consubstantial and indivisible. When we pray to 





the Father, we adore and glorify him together with the Son and the Holy Spirit. ( 245 . 253) 


2790 Grammatically, “our” qualifies a reality common to more than one person. There is only one 
God, and he is recognized as Father by those who, through faith in his only Son, are reborn of him 
by water and the Spirit.^ The Church is this new communion of God and men. United with the 
only Son, who has become “the firstborn among many brethren,” she is in communion with one 
and the same Father in one and the same Holy Spirit.^ In praying “our” Father, each of the 
baptized is praying in this communion: “The company of those who believed were of one heart and 
soul.”— ( 787 ) 

2791 For this reason, in spite of the divisions among Christians, this prayer to “our” Father remains 
our common patrimony and an urgent summons for all the baptized. In communion by faith in 
Christ and by Baptism, they ought to join in Jesus’ prayer for the unity of his disciples.^2 ( 821 1 

2792 Finally, if we pray the Our Father sincerely, we leave individualism behind, because the love 
that we receive frees us from it. The “our” at the beginning of the Lord’s Prayer, like the “us” of the 
last four petitions, excludes no one. If we are to say it truthfully, our divisions and oppositions have 
to be overcome.^ 

2793 The baptized cannot pray to “our” Father without bringing before him all those for whom he 
gave his beloved Son. God’s love has no bounds, neither should our prayer.^ Praying “our” Father 
opens to us the dimensions of his love revealed in Christ: praying with and for all who do not yet 
know him, so that Christ may “gather into one the children of God.”^ God’s care for all men and 
for the whole of creation has inspired all the great practitioners of prayer; it should extend our 
prayer to the full breadth of love whenever we dare to say “our” Father. (604) 

IV. “Who Art in Heaven” 

2794 This biblical expression does not mean a place (“space”), but a way of being; it does not mean 
that God is distant, but majestic. Our Father is not “elsewhere”: he transcends everything we can 
conceive of his holiness. It is precisely because he is thrice-holy that he is so close to the humble 
and contrite heart. (326) 

“Our Father who art in heaven” is rightly understood to mean that God is in the hearts of the 
just, as in his holy temple. At the same time, it means that those who pray should desire the 
one they invoke to dwell in them.^4 








“Heaven” could also be those who bear the image of the heavenly world, and in whom God 
dwells and tarries.^ 

2795 The symbol of the heavens refers us back to the mystery of the covenant we are living when 
we pray to our Father. He is in heaven, his dwelling place; the Father’s house is our homeland. Sin 
has exiled us from the land of the covenant,^ but conversion of heart enables us to return to the 
Father, to heaven.^ In Christ, then, heaven and earth are reconciled,^ for the Son alone 
“descended from heaven” and causes us to ascend there with him, by his Cross, Resurrection, and 
Ascension.-^ (1024) 

2796 When the Church prays “our Father who art in heaven,” she is professing that we are the 
People of God, already seated “with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus” and “hidden with 
Christ in God;”^ yet at the same time, “here indeed we groan, and long to put on our heavenly 
dwelling.”^ (1003) 

[Christians] are in the flesh, but do not live according to the flesh. They spend their lives on 
earth, but are citizens of heaven.^ 


IN BRIEF 

2797 Simple and faithful trust, humble and joyous assurance are the proper dispositions for one 
who prays the Our Father. 

2798 We can invoke God as “Father” because the Son of God made man has revealed him to us. In 
this Son, through Baptism, we are incorporated and adopted as sons of God. 

2799 The Lord’s Prayer brings us into communion with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 
At the same time it reveals us to ourselves (cf. GS 22 § 1). 

2800 Praying to our Father should develop in us the will to become like him and foster in us a 
humble and trusting heart. 

2801 When we say “Our” Father, we are invoking the new covenant in Jesus Christ, communion 
with the Holy Trinity, and the divine love which spreads through the Church to encompass the 
world. 






2802 “Who art in heaven” does not refer to a place but to God’s majesty and his presence in the 
hearts of the just. Heaven, the Father’s house, is the true homeland toward which we are heading 
and to which, already, we belong. 


ARTICLE 3 

THE SEVEN PETITIONS 


2803 After we have placed ourselves in the presence of God our Father to adore and to love and to 
bless him, the Spirit of adoption stirs up in our hearts seven petitions, seven blessings. The first 
three, more theologal, draw us toward the glory of the Father; the last four, as ways toward him, 
commend our wretchedness to his grace. “Deep calls to deep.”h3 ( 2627 1 

2804 The first series of petitions carries us toward him, for his own sake: thy name, thy kingdom, 
thy will! It is characteristic of love to think first of the one whom we love. In none of the three 
petitions do we mention ourselves; the burning desire, even anguish, of the beloved Son for his 
Father’s glory seizes us;h4 “hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done....” These 
three supplications were already answered in the saving sacrifice of Christ, but they are henceforth 
directed in hope toward their final fulfillment, for God is not yet all in all.^ 

2805 The second series of petitions unfolds with the same movement as certain Eucharistic 
epicleses: as an offering up of our expectations, that draws down upon itself the eyes of the Father 
of mercies. They go up from us and concern us from this very moment, in our present world: “give 
us... forgive us... lead us not... deliver us...” The fourth and fifth petitions concern our life as such 
—to be fed and to be healed of sin; the last two concern our battle for the victory of life—that battle 
of prayer. ( 1105 1 

2806 By the three first petitions, we are strengthened in faith, filled with hope, and set aflame by 
charity. Being creatures and still sinners, we have to petition for us, for that “us” bound by the 
world and history, which we offer to the boundless love of God. For through the name of his Christ 
and the reign of his Holy Spirit, our Father accomplishes his plan of salvation, for us and for the 
whole world. ( 2656-2658 1 

I. “Hallowed Be Thy Name” 2142-2159 


2807 The term “to hallow” is to be understood here not primarily in its causative sense (only God 











hallows, makes holy), but above all in an evaluative sense: to recognize as holy, to treat in a holy 
way. And so, in adoration, this invocation is sometimes understood as praise and thanksgiving.^ 
But this petition is here taught to us by Jesus as an optative: a petition, a desire, and an expectation 
in which God and man are involved. Beginning with this first petition to our Father, we are 
immersed in the innermost mystery of his Godhead and the drama of the salvation of our humanity. 
Asking the Father that his name be made holy draws us into his plan of loving kindness for the 
fullness of time, “according to his purpose which he set forth in Christ,” that we might “be holy and 
blameless before him in love.”^? ( 2097 ) 

2808 In the decisive moments of his economy God reveals his name, but he does so by 
accomplishing his work. This work, then, is realized for us and in us only if his name is hallowed 
by us and in us. 

2809 The holiness of God is the inaccessible center of his eternal mystery. What is revealed of it in 
creation and history, Scripture calls “glory,” the radiance of his majesty.^ In making man in his 
image and likeness, God “crowned him with glory and honor,” but by sinning, man fell “short of 
the glory of God.”^ From that time on, God was to manifest his holiness by revealing and giving 
his name, in order to restore man to the image of his Creator.^ ( 203 . 432 . 293 . 705 1 

2810 In the promise to Abraham and the oath that accompanied it , — God commits himself but 
without disclosing his name. He begins to reveal it to Moses and makes it known clearly before the 
eyes of the whole people when he saves them from the Egyptians: “he has triumphed gloriously.”^ 
From the covenant of Sinai onwards, this people is “his own” and it is to be a “holy (or 
“consecrated”: the same word is used for both in Hebrew) nation,”^ because the name of God 
dwells in it. (63) 

2811 In spite of the holy Law that again and again their Holy God gives them — “You shall be 
holy, for I the LORD your God am holy”—and although the Lord shows patience for the sake of his 
name, the people turn away from the Holy One of Israel and profane his name among the nations.^ 
Lor this reason the just ones of the old covenant, the poor survivors returned from exile, and the 
prophets burned with passion for the name. ( 2143 ) 

2812 Linally, in Jesus the name of the Holy God is revealed and given to us, in the flesh, as Savior, 
revealed by what he is, by his word, and by his sacrifice.^ This is the heart of his priestly prayer: 
“Holy Lather... for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in truth.”26 
Because he “sanctifies” his own name, Jesus reveals to us the name of the Lather. At the end of 








Christ’s Passover, the Father gives him the name that is above all names: “Jesus Christ is Lord, to 
the glory of God the Father.”^ (434) 

2813 In the waters of Baptism, we have been “washed... sanctified... justified in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.”^ Our Father calls us to holiness in the whole of 
our life, and since “he is the source of [our] life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from 
God, and... sanctification,”^ both his glory and our life depend on the hallowing of his name in us 
and by us. Such is the urgency of our first petition. ( 2013 1 

By whom is God hallowed, since he is the one who hallows? But since he said, “You shall be 
holy to me; for I the LORD am holy,” we seek and ask that we who were sanctified in Baptism 
may persevere in what we have begun to be. And we ask this daily, for we need sanctification 
daily, so that we who fail daily may cleanse away our sins by being sanctified continually.... 
We pray that this sanctification may remain in us.^i 

2814 The sanctification of his name among the nations depends inseparably on our life and our 
prayer: 1 2045 1 

We ask God to hallow his name, which by its own holiness saves and makes holy all 
creation.... It is this name that gives salvation to a lost world. But we ask that this name of God 
should be hallowed in us through our actions. For God’s name is blessed when we live well, 
but is blasphemed when we live wickedly. As the Apostle says: “The name of God is 
blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.” We ask then that, just as the name of God is 
holy, so we may obtain his holiness in our souls. ^2 

When we say “hallowed be thy name,” we ask that it should be hallowed in us, who are in 
him; but also in others whom God’s grace still awaits, that we may obey the precept that 
obliges us to pray for everyone, even our enemies. That is why we do not say expressly 
“hallowed be thy name Tn us,”’ for we ask that it be so in all men.^ 

2815 This petition embodies all the others. Like the six petitions that follow, it is fulfilled by the 
prayer of Christ. Prayer to our Father is our prayer, if it is prayed in the name of Jesus.24 In his 
priestly prayer, Jesus asks: “Holy Father, protect in your name those whom you have given me . ”^2 
(2750) 


II. “Thy Kingdom Come” 






2816 In the New Testament, the word basileia can be translated by “kingship” (abstract noun), 
“kingdom” (concrete noun) or “reign” (action noun). The Kingdom of God lies ahead of us. It is 
brought near in the Word incarnate, it is proclaimed throughout the whole Gospel, and it has come 
in Christ’s death and Resurrection. The Kingdom of God has been coming since the Last Supper 
and, in the Eucharist, it is in our midst. The kingdom will come in glory when Christ hands it over 
to his Father: (541, 2632, 560, 1107 1 

It may even be... that the Kingdom of God means Christ himself, whom we daily desire to 
come, and whose coming we wish to be manifested quickly to us. For as he is our resurrection, 
since in him we rise, so he can also be understood as the Kingdom of God, for in him we shall 
reign.^ 


2817 This petition is “Marana tha,” the cry of the Spirit and the Bride: “Come, Lord Jesus.” ( 451 . 
2632 . 671 1 

Even if it had not been prescribed to pray for the coming of the kingdom, we would willingly 
have brought forth this speech, eager to embrace our hope. In indignation the souls of the 
martyrs under the altar cry out to the Lord: “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before 
you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the earth?” For their retribution is 
ordained for the end of the world. Indeed, as soon as possible, Lord, may your kingdom 
come!^ 


2818 In the Lord’s Prayer, “thy kingdom come” refers primarily to the final coming of the reign of 
God through Christ’s return.^ But, far from distracting the Church from her mission in this present 
world, this desire commits her to it all the more strongly. Since Pentecost, the coming of that Reign 
is the work of the Spirit of the Lord who “completed] his work on earth and brings us the fullness 
of grace. ”22 (769) 

2819 “The kingdom of God [is] righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.”^ The end- 
time in which we live is the age of the outpouring of the Spirit. Ever since Pentecost, a decisive 
battle has been joined between “the flesh” and the Spirit.^ 1 2046 . 2516 . 2519 1 

Only a pure soul can boldly say: “Thy kingdom come.” One who has heard Paul say, “Let not 
sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies,” and has purified himself in action, thought, and 
word will say to God: “Thy kingdom come! ”22 


2820 By a discernment according to the Spirit, Christians have to distinguish between the growth of 













the Reign of God and the progress of the culture and society in which they are involved. This 
distinction is not a separation. Man’s vocation to eternal life does not suppress, but actually 
reinforces, his duty to put into action in this world the energies and means received from the 
Creator to serve justice and peace.33 (1049) 

2821 This petition is taken up and granted in the prayer of Jesus which is present and effective in 
the Eucharist; it bears its fruit in new life in keeping with the Beatitudes. 34 ( 2746 1 

III. “Thy Will Be Done on Earth as It Is in Heaven” 

2822 Our Father “desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.”32 He “is 
forbearing toward you, not wishing that any should perish.”33 His commandment is “that you love 
one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”3Z This commandment 
summarizes all the others and expresses his entire will. (851, 2196 1 

2823 “He has made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set 
forth in Christ... to gather up all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. In Christ we 
have also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the purpose of him who 
accomplishes all things according to his counsel and will. ”32 We ask insistently for this loving plan 
to be fully realized on earth as it is already in heaven. (59 1 

2824 In Christ, and through his human will, the will of the Father has been perfectly fulfilled once 
for all. Jesus said on entering into this world: “Fo, I have come to do your will, O God.”33 Only 
Jesus can say: “I always do what is pleasing to him.”133 In the prayer of his agony, he consents 
totally to this will: “not my will, but yours be done.”131 For this reason Jesus “gave himself for our 
sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father.”132 “And 
by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for 
all. ”132 (475, 612 1 

2825 “Although he was a Son, [Jesus] learned obedience through what he suffered.”134 How much 
more reason have we sinful creatures to learn obedience—we who in him have become children of 
adoption. We ask our Father to unite our will to his Son’s, in order to fulfill his will, his plan of 
salvation for the life of the world. We are radically incapable of this, but united with Jesus and with 
the power of his Holy Spirit, we can surrender our will to him and decide to choose what his Son 
has always chosen: to do what is pleasing to the Father.132 ( 615 1 


In committing ourselves to [Christ], we can become one spirit with him, and thereby 










accomplish his will, in such wise that it will be perfect on earth as it is in heaven.l^ 

Consider how [Jesus Christ] teaches us to be humble, by making us see that our virtue does 
not depend on our work alone but on grace from on high. He commands each of the faithful 
who prays to do so universally, for the whole world. For he did not say “thy will be done in 
me or in us,” but “on earth,” the whole earth, so that error may be banished from it, truth take 
root in it, all vice be destroyed on it, virtue flourish on it, and earth no longer differ from 

heaven.^ 


2826 By prayer we can discern “what is the will of God” and obtain the endurance to do it.l^ Jesus 
teaches us that one enters the kingdom of heaven not by speaking words, but by doing “the will of 
my Father in heaven.”h!9 

2827 “If any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.”TLQ Such is the power 
of the Church’s prayer in the name of her Lord, above ah in the Eucharist. Her prayer is also a 
communion of intercession with the all-holy Mother of God^i and ah the saints who have been 
pleasing to the Lord because they willed his will alone: [ 2611 . 796 1 

It would not be inconsistent with the truth to understand the words, “Thy will be done on earth 
as it is in heaven,” to mean: “in the Church as in our Lord Jesus Christ himself”; or “in the 
Bride who has been betrothed, just as in the Bridegroom who has accomplished the will of the 

Father. ”112 


IV. “Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread” 

2828 “Give us”: The trust of children who look to their Father for everything is beautiful. “He 
makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.”H2 He 
gives to all the living “their food in due season. ”114 Jesus teaches us this petition, because it 
glorifies our Father by acknowledging how good he is, beyond all goodness. ( 2778 ) 

2829 “Give us” also expresses the covenant. We are his and he is ours, for our sake. But this “us” 
also recognizes him as the Father of all men and we pray to him for them all, in solidarity with their 
needs and sufferings. [ 1939 1 

2830 “Our bread”: The Father who gives us life cannot but give us the nourishment life requires— 
all appropriate goods and blessings, both material and spiritual. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus 
insists on the filial trust that cooperates with our Father’s providence.TL5 He is not inviting us to 






idleness, 11^ but wants to relieve us from nagging worry and preoccupation. Such is the filial 
surrender of the children of God: 1 2633 . 227 ) 


To those who seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness, he has promised to give all else 
besides. Since everything indeed belongs to God, he who possesses God wants for nothing, if 
he himself is not found wanting before God.l^ 

2831 But the presence of those who hunger because they lack bread opens up another profound 
meaning of this petition. The drama of hunger in the world calls Christians who pray sincerely to 
exercise responsibility toward their brethren, both in their personal behavior and in their solidarity 
with the human family. This petition of the Lord’s Prayer cannot be isolated from the parables of 
the poor man Lazarus and of the Last Judgment.!!!! (1038) 

2832 As leaven in the dough, the newness of the kingdom should make the earth “rise” by the 
Spirit of Christ.This must be shown by the establishment of justice in personal and social, 
economic and international relations, without ever forgetting that there are no just structures 
without people who want to be just. ( 1928 ) 

2833 “Our” bread is the “one” loaf for the “many.” In the Beatitudes “poverty” is the virtue of 
sharing: it calls us to communicate and share both material and spiritual goods, not by coercion but 
out of love, so that the abundance of some may remedy the needs of others.!^ 1 2790 . 2546) 

2834 “Pray and work.”!!! “Pray as if everything depended on God and work as if everything 
depended on you.”!!! Even when we have done our work, the food we receive is still a gift from 
our Father; it is good to ask him for it and to thank him, as Christian families do when saying grace 
at meals. ( 2428 ) 

2835 This petition, with the responsibility it involves, also applies to another hunger from which 
men are perishing: “Man does not live by bread alone, but... by every word that proceeds from the 
mouth of God,”!!! that is, by the Word he speaks and the Spirit he breathes forth. Christians must 
make every effort “to proclaim the good news to the poor.” There is a famine on earth, “not a 
famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD. ”1^4 For this reason 
the specifically Christian sense of this fourth petition concerns the Bread of Life: The Word of God 
accepted in faith, the Body of Christ received in the Eucharist.!!! 1 2443 .1384) 

2836 “This day ” is also an expression of trust taught us by the Lord,!!! which we would never have 
presumed to invent. Since it refers above all to his Word and to the Body of his Son, this “today” is 











not only that of our mortal time, but also the “today” of God. (1165) 


If you receive the bread each day, each day is today for you. If Christ is yours today, he rises 
for you every day. How can this be? “You are my Son, today I have begotten you.” Therefore, 
“today” is when Christ rises.!!! 

2837 “Daily” ( epiousios ) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Taken in a temporal sense, 
this word is a pedagogical repetition of “this day,”!!^ to confirm us in trust “without reservation.” 
Taken in the qualitative sense, it signifies what is necessary for life, and more broadly every good 
thing sufficient for subsistence.!? Taken literally ( epi-ousios: “super-essential”), it refers directly 
to the Bread of Life, the Body of Christ, the “medicine of immortality,” without which we have no 
life within us.!?2 Finally in this connection, its heavenly meaning is evident: “this day” is the Day 
of the Lord, the day of the feast of the kingdom, anticipated in the Eucharist that is already the 
foretaste of the kingdom to come. For this reason it is fitting for the Eucharistic liturgy to be 
celebrated each day. (2659, 2633,1405, U66, 1389 1 

The Eucharist is our daily bread. The power belonging to this divine food makes it a bond of 
union. Its effect is then understood as unity, so that, gathered into his Body and made 
members of him, we may become what we receive.... This also is our daily bread: the readings 
you hear each day in church and the hymns you hear and sing. All these are necessities for our 
pilgrimage.!?! 

The Father in heaven urges us, as children of heaven, to ask for the bread of heaven. [Christ] 
himself is the bread who, sown in the Virgin, raised up in the flesh, kneaded in the Passion, 
baked in the oven of the tomb, reserved in churches, brought to altars, furnishes the faithful 
each day with food from heaven.!!? 

V. “And Forgive Us Our Trespasses, as We Forgive Those Who Trespass Against Us” 

2838 This petition is astonishing. If it consisted only of the first phrase, “And forgive us our 
trespasses,” it might have been included, implicitly, in the first three petitions of the Lord’s Prayer, 
since Christ’s sacrifice is “that sins may be forgiven.” But, according to the second phrase, our 
petition will not be heard unless we have first met a strict requirement. Our petition looks to the 
future, but our response must come first, for the two parts are joined by the single word “as.” ( 1425 . 
1933 . 2631 1 


And forgive us our trespasses... 











2839 With bold confidence, we began praying to our Father. In begging him that his name be 
hallowed, we were in fact asking him that we ourselves might be always made more holy. But 
though we are clothed with the baptismal garment, we do not cease to sin, to turn away from God. 
Now, in this new petition, we return to him like the prodigal son and, like the tax collector, 
recognize that we are sinners before him.d23 Our petition begins with a “confession” of our 
wretchedness and his mercy. Our hope is firm because, in his Son, “we have redemption, the 
forgiveness of sins. ”224 y/e find the efficacious and undoubted sign of his forgiveness in the 
sacraments of his Church.125 ( 1425 . 1439 . 1422 1 

2840 Now—and this is daunting—this outpouring of mercy cannot penetrate our hearts as long as 
we have not forgiven those who have trespassed against us. Love, like the Body of Christ, is 
indivisible; we cannot love the God we cannot see if we do not love the brother or sister we do 
see.136 i n refusing to forgive our brothers and sisters, our hearts are closed and their hardness 
makes them impervious to the Father’s merciful love; but in confessing our sins, our hearts are 
opened to his grace. 1 1864 1 

2841 This petition is so important that it is the only one to which the Lord returns and which he 
develops explicitly in the Sermon on the Mount.i^Z This crucial requirement of the covenant 
mystery is impossible for man. But “with God all things are possible.”!^ 

...as we forgive those who trespass against us 

2842 This “as” is not unique in Jesus’ teaching: “You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly 
Father is perfect”; “Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful”; “A new commandment I give to 
you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”^ it is 
impossible to keep the Lord’s commandment by imitating the divine model from outside; there has 
to be a vital participation, coming from the depths of the heart, in the holiness and the mercy and 
the love of our God. Only the Spirit by whom we live can make “ours” the same mind that was in 
Christ Jesus.i^Q Then the unity of forgiveness becomes possible and we find ourselves “forgiving 
one another, as God in Christ forgave” us.d^l (521) 

2843 Thus the Lord’s words on forgiveness, the love that loves to the end, 142 become a living 
reality. The parable of the merciless servant, which crowns the Lord’s teaching on ecclesial 
communion, ends with these words: “So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if 
you do not forgive your brother from your heart.”143 ft is there, in fact, “in the depths of the heart,” 
that everything is bound and loosed. It is not in our power not to feel or to forget an offense; but the 







heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit turns injury into compassion and purifies the memory in 
transforming the hurt into intercession. ( 368 ) 

2844 Christian prayer extends to the forgiveness of enemies transfiguring the disciple by 
configuring him to his Master. Forgiveness is a high-point of Christian prayer; only hearts attuned 
to God’s compassion can receive the gift of prayer. Forgiveness also bears witness that, in our 
world, love is stronger than sin. The martyrs of yesterday and today bear this witness to Jesus. 
Forgiveness is the fundamental condition of the reconciliation of the children of God with their 
Father and of men with one another.!^ (2262) 

2845 There is no limit or measure to this essentially divine forgiveness,!^ whether one speaks of 
“sins” as in Luke (11:4), or “debts” as in Matthew (6:12). We are always debtors: “Owe no one 
anything, except to love one another.”!^ The communion of the Holy Trinity is the source and 
criterion of truth in every relationship. It is lived out in prayer, above all in the Eucharist.!^ ( 1441 1 

God does not accept the sacrifice of a sower of disunion, but commands that he depart from 
the altar so that he may first be reconciled with his brother. For God can be appeased only by 
prayers that make peace. To God, the better offering is peace, brotherly concord, and a people 
made one in the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.!^ 

VI. “And Lead Us Not into Temptation” 

2846 This petition goes to the root of the preceding one, for our sins result from our consenting to 
temptation; we therefore ask our Father not to “lead” us into temptation. It is difficult to translate 
the Greek verb used by a single English word: the Greek means both “do not allow us to enter into 
temptation” and “do not let us yield to temptation.”!^ “God cannot be tempted by evil and he 
himself tempts no one”;!^l on the contrary, he wants to set us free from evil. We ask him not to 
allow us to take the way that leads to sin. We are engaged in the battle “between flesh and spirit”; 
this petition implores the Spirit of discernment and strength. (164, 2516 ) 

2847 The Holy Spirit makes us discern between trials, which are necessary for the growth of the 
inner man,!^ and temptation, which leads to sin and death.!^ We must also discern between being 
tempted and consenting to temptation. Finally, discernment unmasks the lie of temptation, whose 
object appears to be good, a “delight to the eyes” and desirable,!^ when in reality its fruit is death. 
1 2284 1 


God does not want to impose the good, but wants free beings.... There is a certain usefulness 








to temptation. No one but God knows what our soul has received from him, not even we 
ourselves. But temptation reveals it in order to teach us to know ourselves, and in this way we 
discover our evil inclinations and are obliged to give thanks for the goods that temptation has 
revealed to us. 1^5 

2848 “Lead us not into temptation” implies a decision of the heart: “For where your treasure is, 
there will your heart be also.... No one can serve two masters. ”1^6 “if we live by the Spirit, let us 
also walk by the Spirit.”^? i n this assent to the Holy Spirit the Father gives us strength. “No testing 
has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted 
beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, so that you may 
be able to endure it.”i^8 (1808) 

2849 Such a battle and such a victory become possible only through prayer. It is by his prayer that 
Jesus vanquishes the tempter, both at the outset of his public mission and in the ultimate struggle of 
his agony.l^ in this petition to our heavenly Father, Christ unites us to his battle and his agony. He 
urges us to vigilance of the heart in communion with his own. Vigilance is “custody of the heart,” 
and Jesus prayed for us to the Father: “Keep them in your name.”lh2 The Holy Spirit constantly 
seeks to awaken us to keep watch.i^i Finally, this petition takes on all its dramatic meaning in 
relation to the last temptation of our earthly battle; it asks for final perseverance. “Lo, I am coming 
like a thief! Blessed is he who is awake. (540, 612, 2612 . 162 1 

VII. “But Deliver Us from Evil” 

2850 The last petition to our Father is also included in Jesus’ prayer: “I am not asking you to take 
them out of the world, but I ask you to protect them from the evil one.”i^ it touches each of us 
personally, but it is always “we” who pray, in communion with the whole Church, for the 
deliverance of the whole human family. The Lord’s Prayer continually opens us to the range of 
God’s economy of salvation. Our interdependence in the drama of sin and death is turned into 
solidarity in the Body of Christ, the “communion of saints.”^ (309) 

2851 In this petition, evil is not an abstraction, but refers to a person, Satan, the Evil One, the angel 
who opposes God. The devil ( dia-bolos ) is the one who “throws himself across” God’s plan and his 
work of salvation accomplished in Christ. (391) 

2852 “A murderer from the beginning,... a liar and the father of lies,” Satan is “the deceiver of the 
whole world.”!^ Through him sin and death entered the world and by his definitive defeat all 









creation will be “freed from the corruption of sin and death.Now “we know that anyone born 
of God does not sin, but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. 
We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of the evil one.”l^ 

The Lord who has taken away your sin and pardoned your faults also protects you and keeps 
you from the wiles of your adversary the devil, so that the enemy, who is accustomed to 
leading into sin, may not surprise you. One who entrusts himself to God does not dread the 
devil. “If God is for us, who is against us?”d^ 

2853 Victory over the “prince of this world”^ was won once for all at the Hour when Jesus freely 
gave himself up to death to give us his life. This is the judgment of this world, and the prince of this 
world is “cast out.”±2Q “He pursued the woman”d^l but had no hold on her: the new Eve, “full of 
grace” of the Holy Spirit, is preserved from sin and the corruption of death (the Immaculate 
Conception and the Assumption of the Most Holy Mother of God, Mary, ever virgin). “Then the 
dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring.” 1Z2 
Therefore the Spirit and the Church pray: “Come, Lord Jesus, ”1^ since his coming will deliver us 
from the Evil One. (6ZZ, 490, 972) 

2854 When we ask to be delivered from the Evil One, we pray as well to be freed from all evils, 
present, past, and future, of which he is the author or instigator. In this final petition, the Church 
brings before the Father all the distress of the world. Along with deliverance from the evils that 
overwhelm humanity, she implores the precious gift of peace and the grace of perseverance in 
expectation of Christ’s return. By praying in this way, she anticipates in humility of faith the 
gathering together of everyone and everything in him who has “the keys of Death and Hades,” who 
“is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”1^4 ( 2632 . 1041 ) 

Deliver us, Lord, we beseech you, from every evil and grant us peace in our day, so that aided 
by your mercy we might be ever free from sin and protected from all anxiety, as we await the 
blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.^ 

ARTICLE 4 

THE FINAL DOXOLOGY 


2855 The final doxology, “For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours, now and forever,” 
takes up again, by inclusion, the first three petitions to our Father: the glorification of his name, the 
coming of his reign, and the power of his saving will. But these prayers are now proclaimed as 









adoration and thanksgiving, as in the liturgy of heaven.^ The ruler of this world has mendaciously 
attributed to himself the three titles of kingship, power, and glory.J^Z Christ, the Lord, restores 
them to his Father and our Father, until he hands over the kingdom to him when the mystery of 
salvation will be brought to its completion and God will be all in all. 128 (2760) 

2856 “Then, after the prayer is over you say ‘Amen,’ which means ‘So be it,’ thus ratifying with 
our ‘Amen’ what is contained in the prayer that God has taught us. ”122 (106LT065) 


IN BRIEF 

2857 In the Our Father, the object of the first three petitions is the glory of the Father: the 
sanctification of his name, the coming of the kingdom, and the fulfillment of his will. The four 
others present our wants to him: they ask that our lives be nourished, healed of sin, and made 
victorious in the struggle of good over evil. 

2858 By asking “hallowed be thy name” we enter into God’s plan, the sanctification of his name— 
revealed first to Moses and then in Jesus—by us and in us, in every nation and in each man. 

2859 By the second petition, the Church looks first to Christ’s return and the final coming of the 
Reign of God. It also prays for the growth of the Kingdom of God in the “today” of our own lives. 

2860 In the third petition, we ask our Father to unite our will to that of his Son, so as to fulfill his 
plan of salvation in the life of the world. 

2861 In the fourth petition, by saying “give us,” we express in communion with our brethren our 
filial trust in our heavenly Father. “Our daily bread” refers to the earthly nourishment necessary to 
everyone for subsistence, and also to the Bread of Life: the Word of God and the Body of Christ. It 
is received in God’s “today,” as the indispensable, (super-) essential nourishment of the feast of the 
coming Kingdom anticipated in the Eucharist. 

2862 The fifth petition begs God’s mercy for our offences, mercy which can penetrate our hearts 
only if we have learned to forgive our enemies, with the example and help of Christ. 

2863 When we say “lead us not into temptation” we are asking God not to allow us to take the path 
that leads to sin. This petition implores the Spirit of discernment and strength; it requests the grace 
of vigilance and final perseverance. 








2864 In the last petition, “but deliver us from evil,” Christians pray to God with the Church to show 
forth the victory, already won by Christ, over the “ruler of this world,” Satan, the angel personally 
opposed to God and to his plan of salvation. 

2865 By the final “Amen,” we express our “fiat” concerning the seven petitions: “So be it.”

INDEX 


Prefatory Note to Index 

The following index is an English translation of the Index Analyticus that appeared in the Latin 
typical edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, promulgated on August 15, 1997. For the 
most part, this index is a literal rendering of the Latin, with attention given to maintaining 
consistency with the language of the English edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The 
Index Analyticus was designed to be both a general subject index as well as a conceptual index of 
the contents of the Catechism, and this English translation is faithful to that design. This English 
translation does not participate in the approval of the Latin typical edition given in the apostolic 
letter Laetamur Magnopere of Pope John Paul II, by which the Latin text was approved and 
promulgated.

GLOSSARY 


PREFATORY NOTE TO THE GLOSSARY 

Even before the promulgation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a Glossary had been 
proposed to provide assistance to those who would use the new Catechism. This Glossary has been 
prepared by Archbishop William J. Levada, who served as a member of the Editorial Committee of 
the Special Commission of the Holy See for the Catechism of the Catholic Church. It has been 
reviewed by the NCCB ad hoc Committee to Oversee the Use of the Catechism, as well as by the 
chairman and staff of the NCCB Committee on Doctrine. 

This Glossary has been composed with reference to the language of the Catechism itself: the 
numbers in parentheses refer to the number(s) in the Catechism where the term or concept is 
explained. The criterion for the selection of words included in this Glossary is twofold: (1) 
unfamiliar or technical terms are defined, in order to assist readers who are not acquainted with 
them through formal religious or theological studies; and (2) multiple meanings or uses of familiar 
terms are presented, thus alerting readers to the various uses of the term in Church doctrine. 
Common words and most proper names are not listed in this Glossary, nor are religious terms 
which are not directly or indirectly present in the Catechism. 

It is important to remember that this Glossary, like the Catechism’s Indexes, is an additional 
instrument by which readers may find assistance in their use of the Catechism itself. While the 
Glossary is faithful to the language of the Catechism, it does not participate in the approval of the 
text of the Catechism given in the Apostolic Constitution Fidei depositum of Pope John Paul II.

U | V | W | Y 


-A- 


ABORTION: Deliberate termination of pregnancy by killing the unborn child. Such direct 
abortion, willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law. The Church 
attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life 1 2271-2272 1. 



ABRAHAM: The man of faith and patriarch of Israel with whom God made a covenant which 
promised him land in which to live and many descendants, a great people for whom the Lord would 
be their God. Through Abraham God formed the people to whom he would later give the law by 
revelation to Moses. With the advent of Christ, the people of Israel would serve as the root to which 
the Gentiles would be grafted by their coming to believe (59, 72,145, 705, 762, 2570 1. 

ABSOLUTION: An essential element of the Sacrament of Penance in which the priest, by the 
power entrusted to the Church by Christ, pardons the sin(s) of the penitent ( 1424 . 1442 . 1449 . 
1453 . 1480 1. 

ACEDIA: A less common synonym for sloth, one of the seven “capital” sins 1 1866 1. See Sloth . 

ACOLYTE: A liturgical minister appointed to assist at liturgical celebrations. Priests and deacons 
receive this ministry before they are ordained. Lay men may be installed permanently in the 
ministry of acolyte through a rite of institution and blessing (903, 1672 1. 

ADAM: According to the creation story in Genesis, the first man. From this story the Church has 
learned that humanity was originally created in a state of holiness and justice and that the first 
ancestors of the human race lost this state for themselves and all humanity by their sin (“original 
sin”). Christ is called the “second” or “new Adam” because he ushered in the new creation by 
forgiving sin and restoring humanity to the grace of God’s friendship lost by original sin (359, 375 . 
388 . 390 . 402-404 . 504 : cf. 635, 655 1. 

ADORATION: The acknowledgment of God as God, Creator and Savior, the Lord and Master of 
everything that exists. Through worship and prayer, the Church and individual persons give to God 
the adoration which is the first act of the virtue of religion. The first commandment of the law 
obliges us to adore God 12096 . 2628 : cf. 1083 1. 

ADULTERY : Marital infidelity, or sexual relations between two partners, at least one of whom is 
married to another party. The sixth commandment and the New Testament forbid adultery 
absolutely 1 2380 : cf. 1650 1. 

ADVENT : The liturgical season of four weeks devoted to preparation for the coming of Christ at 
Christmas (524). 

ALMSGIVING: Money or goods given to the poor as an act of penance or fraternal charity. 
Almsgiving, together with prayer and fasting, are traditionally recommended to foster the state of 





























interior penance ( 1434 : cf. 1969 . 2447 1 


ALTAR: The center and focal point of a church, where the sacrifice of Christ on the cross is made 
present under sacramental signs in the Mass. Among the Israelites the altar was the place where 
sacrifices were offered to God. The Christian altar represents two aspects of the mystery of the 
Eucharist, as the altar of sacrifice where Christ as the sacrificial victim offers himself for our sins 
and as the table of the Lord where Christ gives himself to us as food from heaven ( 1182 . 1383 1 

AMEN: A Hebrew word meaning “truly; it is so; let it be done,” signifying agreement with what 
has been said. The prayers of the New Testament and of the Church’s liturgy, and the Creeds, 
conclude with “amen.” Jesus used the word to introduce solemn assertions, to emphasize their 
trustworthiness and authority ( 1061 . 1345 . 1396 . 2856 . 2865 1 

ANALOGY OF FAITH: The coherence of the truths of the faith among themselves and within the 
whole plan of Revelation ( 114 ). 

ANAMNESIS: The “remembrance” of God’s saving deeds in history in the liturgical action of the 
Church, which inspires thanksgiving and praise ( 1103 1 Every Eucharistic Prayer contains an 
anamnesis or memorial in which the Church calls to mind the Passion, Resurrection, and glorious 
return of Christ Jesus ( 1354 . 1362 ). 

ANAPHORA: The Eucharistic Prayer—the prayer of thanksgiving and consecration—which is the 
heart and summit of the celebration of the Mass (1352). 

ANGEL: A spiritual, personal, and immortal creature, with intelligence and free will, who glorifies 
God without ceasing and who serves God as a messenger of his saving plan ( 329-331 1 See 
Guardian Angels . 

ANGER: An emotion which is not in itself wrong, but which, when it is not controlled by reason 
or hardens into resentment and hate, becomes one of the seven capital sins. Christ taught that anger 
is an offense against the fifth commandment ( 1765 . 1866 . 2262 1 

ANNUNCIATION: The visit of the angel Gabriel to the virgin Mary to inform her that she was to 
be the mother of the Savior. After giving her consent to God’s word, Mary became the mother of 
Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit (484, 494 ). 


ANOINTING: A symbol of the Holy Spirit, whose “anointing” of Jesus as Messiah fulfilled the 
























prophecies of the Old Testament. Christ (in Hebrew Messiah ) means the one “anointed” by the 
Holy Spirit. Anointing is the sacramental sign of Confirmation, called Chrismation in the Churches 
of the East. Anointings form part of the liturgical rites of the catechumenate, and of the Sacraments 
of Baptism and Holy Orders (695). See Christ . 

ANOINTING OF THE SICK: One of the seven sacraments, also known as the “sacrament of the 
dying,” administered by a priest to a baptized person who begins to be in danger of death because 
of illness or old age, through prayer and the anointing of the body with the oil of the sick. The 
proper effects of the sacrament include a special grace of healing and comfort to the Christian who 
is suffering the infirmities of serious illness or old age, and the forgiving of the person’s sins 1 1499 . 
1520 . 1523 . 1526-1532 1. 

ANTICHRIST: The “deceitful one” referred to in the New Testament, associated with the 
“mystery of iniquity” which will precede the second coming of Christ, through which people will 
be led away from the truth to follow a false “messianism,” by which man glorifies himself and 
human achievement in place of God and his Messiah come in the flesh, in whom the kingdom will 
be fulfilled 1 675-677 1. 

APOSTASY: The total repudiation of the Christian faith 1 2089 : cf. 817 1. 

APOSTLE: A term meaning one who is sent as Jesus was sent by the Father, and as he sent his 
chosen disciples to preach the Gospel to the whole world. He called the Twelve to become his 
Apostles, chosen witnesses of his Resurrection and the foundation on which the Church is built 
(857). 

The apostolic office is permanent in the Church, in order to ensure that the divine mission entrusted 
to the Apostles by Jesus will continue to the end of time. The bishops receive their office as 
successors of the Apostles through the Sacrament of Holy Orders (860). See Apostolic Succession . 

APOSTLES’ CREED: A statement of Christian faith developed from the baptismal creed or 
“symbol” of the ancient Church of Rome, the see of St. Peter, first of the Apostles. The Apostles’ 
Creed is considered to be a faithful summary of the faith of the Apostles 1 194 1. 

APOSTOLATE: The activity of the Christian which fulfills the apostolic nature of the whole 
Church by working to extend the reign of Christ to the entire world 18631. 


APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION: The handing on of apostolic preaching and authority from the 
















Apostles to their successors the bishops through the laying on of hands, as a permanent office in the 
Church (77, 861 1. 


APPARITION: An appearance to people on earth of a heavenly being—Christ, Mary, an angel, or 
a saint. The apparitions of Jesus in his risen body to his disciples occurred between Easter and his 
Ascension into heaven 1 641 . 659). 

ASCENSION: The entry of Jesus’ humanity into divine glory in God’s heavenly domain, forty 
days after his Resurrection (659, 665). 

ASCESIS: The practice of penance, mortification, and self-denial to promote greater self-mastery 
and to foster the way of perfection by embracing the way of the cross (2015). 

ASSUMPTION: The dogma which recognizes the Blessed Virgin Mary’s singular participation in 
her Son’s Resurrection by which she was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory, when the 
course of her earthly life was finished (966). 

ATHEISM: The denial in theory and/or practice that God exists. Atheism is a sin against the virtue 
of religion required by the first commandment of the law ( 2124-2125 1. 

-B- 

BAPTISM: The first of the seven sacraments, and the “door” which gives access to the other 
sacraments. Baptism is the first and chief sacrament of forgiveness of sins because it unites us with 
Christ, who died for our sins and rose for our justification. Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist 
constitute the “sacraments of initiation” by which a believer receives the remission of original and 
personal sin, begins a new life in Christ and the Holy Spirit, and is incorporated into the Church, 
the Body of Christ. The rite of Baptism consists in immersing the candidate in water, or pouring 
water on the head, while pronouncing the invocation of the Most Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, 
and the Holy Spirit ( 977 . 1213 ff.; 1275, 1278). 

BEATIFIC VISION: The contemplation of God in heavenly glory, a gift of God which is a 
constitutive element of the happiness (or beatitude) of heaven ( 1028 . 1720 1. 

BEATITUDE: Happiness or blessedness, especially the eternal happiness of heaven, which is 
described as the vision of God, or entering into God’s rest by those whom He makes “partakers of 
the divine nature” ( 1024 . 1721 1. 


















BEATITUDES: The teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount on the meaning and way to 
true happiness (cf. Mt 5:1-12; Lk 6:20-23). These teachings reflect the promises made to the 
chosen people since Abraham; they portray the countenance of Christ and describe his charity. 
More- over, by shedding light on the actions and attitudes characteristic of the Christian life, they 
describe the vocation of all the faithful 1 1716 1. 

BIBLE: Sacred Scripture: the books which contain the truth of God’s Revelation and were 
composed by human authors inspired by the Holy Spirit ( 105 1. The Bible contains both the forty- 
six books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament (120). See Old 
Testament : New Testament . 

BIBLICAL INSPIRATION: The gift of the Holy Spirit which assisted a human author to write a 
biblical book so that it has God as its author and teaches faithfully, without error, the saving truth 
that God has willed to be consigned to us 11051. 

BISHOP: One who has received the fullness of the Sacrament of Holy Orders, which makes him a 
member of the episcopal college and a successor of the Apostles. He is the shepherd of a particular 
church entrusted to him ( 1557 : cf. 861, 886 1. 

BLASPHEMY : Speech, thought, or action involving contempt for God or the Church, or persons 
or things dedicated to God. Blasphemy is directly opposed to the second commandment 1 2148 1. 

BLESSED SACRAMENT: A name given to the Holy Eucharist, especially the consecrated 
elements reserved in the tabernacle for adoration, or for the sick 1 1330 1. 

BLESSING: A blessing or benediction is a prayer invoking God’s power and care upon some 
person, place, thing, or undertaking. The prayer of benediction acknowledges God as the source of 
all blessing. Some blessings confer a permanent status: consecration of persons to God, or setting 
things apart for liturgical usage 1 1671 . 2626 1. 

BODY OF CHRIST: (1) The human body which the Son of God assumed through his conception 
in the womb of Mary and which is now glorified in heaven 1 467 . 476 . 645 1. (2) This same Body 
and Blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ are sacramentally present in 
the Eucharist under the appearances of bread and wine 1 1374 1. (3) The Church is called the 
(mystical) Body of Christ because of the intimate communion which Jesus shares with his 
disciples; the metaphor of a body, whose head is Christ and whose members are the faithful, 
provides an image which keeps in focus both the unity and the diversity of the Church (787, 790 . 






















1396). 


-C- 

C ALUMNY : A false statement which harms the reputation of others and gives occasion for false 
judgments concerning them ( 2477 ). 

CANON LAW: The rules (canons or laws) which provide the norms for good order in the visible 
society of the Church. Those canon laws that apply universally are contained in the Codes of Canon 
Law. The most recent Code of Canon Law was promulgated in 1983 for the Latin (Western) 
Church and in 1991 for the Eastern Church (The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches ). 

CANON OF THE MASS: The central part of the Mass, also known as the Eucharistic Prayer or 
“anaphora,” which contains the prayer of thanksgiving and consecration ( 1352 1. 

CANON OF SCRIPTURE: The Church’s complete list of sacred books of the Bible ( 120 1. 

CANONIZATION: The solemn declaration by the Pope that a deceased member of the faithful 
may be proposed as a model and intercessor to the Christian faithful and venerated as a saint on the 
basis of the fact that the person lived a life of heroic virtue or remained faithful to God through 
martyrdom ( 828 : cf. 957 1. 

CAPITAL SINS: Sins which engender other sins and vices. They are traditionally numbered as 
seven: pride, covetousness, envy, anger, gluttony, lust, and sloth ( 1866 1. 

CARDINAL VIRTUES: Four pivotal human virtues (from the Latin carbo, “pivot”): prudence, 
justice, fortitude, and temperance. The human virtues are stable dispositions of the intellect and will 
that govern our acts, order our passions, and guide our conduct in accordance with reason and faith 
( 1805 . 1834 1. 

CATECHESIS: An education of children, young people, and adults in the faith of the Church 
through the teaching of Christian doctrine in an organic and systematic way to make them disciples 
of Jesus Christ. Those who perform the ministry of catechists in the Church are called “catechists” 
(5, 426-427 1. 

CATECHISM: A popular summary or compendium of Catholic doctrine about faith and morals 
and designed for use in catechists (11). 












CATECHUMEN: A person who is preparing for Baptism. The catechumenate is the formation of 
these catechumens in preparation for their Christian Initiation, and aims at bringing their 
conversion and their faith to maturity within the occlusal community ( 1248 1. The candidates are 
anointed with oil of catechumens by which they are strengthened in their conversion from sin and 
renunciation of Satan 1 1237 1. 

CATHEDRAL: The official church of the bishop of a diocese. The Greek word cathedra means 
chair or throne; the bishop’s “chair” symbolizes his teaching and governing authority, and is 
located in the principal church or “cathedral” of the local diocese of which he is the chief pastor (cf. 
1572 1. 

CATHOLIC: One of the four marks or notes of the Church, taken from the Nicene Creed. The 
Church is catholic or universal both because she possesses the fullness of Christ’s presence and the 
means of salvation, and because she has been sent out by Christ on a mission to the whole of the 
human race (750, 830 1. 

CATHOLIC CHURCH: The Church established by Christ on the foundation of the Apostles, 
possessing the fullness of the means of salvation which he has willed: correct and complete 
confession of faith, full sacramental life, and ordained ministry in apostolic succession (830). 

CELIBACY: The state or condition of those who have chosen to remain unmarried for the sake of 
the kingdom of heaven in order to give themselves entirely to God and to the service of his people. 
In the Latin Church, celibacy is obligatory for bishops and priests. In some Eastern Churches, 
celibacy is a prerequisite for the ordination only of bishops; priests may not marry after they have 
been ordained 1 1579 . 1580 1. 

CHARACTER, SACRAMENTAL: An indelible spiritual mark which is the permanent effect of 
the Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders, by which a person is given a new 
permanent configuration to Christ and a specific standing in the Church; the reception of these 
sacraments is never repeated 1 1272 . 1304 . 1582 1. 

CHARISM: A specific gift or grace of the Holy Spirit which directly or indirectly benefits the 
Church, given in order to help a person live out the Christian life, or to serve the common good in 
building up the Church 1 799 . 951 1. 

CHARITY : The theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and 
our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God 1 1822 1. 
















CHASTITY: The moral virtue which, under the cardinal virtue of temperance, provides for the 
successful integration of sexuality within the person leading to the inner unity of the bodily and 
spiritual being ( 2337 1. Chastity is called one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit ( 1832 1. 

CHOIR: A group of persons trained to lead in the singing at liturgical celebrations ( 1143 1. 

CHRISM: Perfumed oil, consecrated by the bishop, which signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
Chrism is used for consecration in the Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Orders 
( 1241 . 1289 . 1291 . 1294 1. 

CHRISMATION: The name used in the Eastern Churches for the Sacrament of Confirmation, 
from the “chrism” or “myron” used in the anointing ( 1289 1. 

CHRIST: From the Greek translation of the Hebrew Messiah, which means “anointed.” It became 
the name proper to Jesus because he accomplished perfectly the divine mission of priest, prophet, 
and King, signified by his anointing as Messiah, “Christ” (4361. See Jesus Christ : Messiah : 
Anointing . 

CHRISTIAN: A name derived from that of Christ himself. The name refers to all those who have 
been anointed through the gift of the Holy Spirit in Baptism; hence, the followers of Christ, the 
members of the Christian Church. According to Acts 11:26 “it was in Antioch that the disciples 
were first called Christians” ( 1289 1. 

CHRISTMAS: The feast of the Nativity, the birth of Jesus ( 1171 1. 

CHURCH: The name given the “convocation” or “assembly” of the People God has called 
together from “the ends of the earth.” In Christian usage, the word “Church” has three inseparable 
meanings: the People that God gathers in the whole world; the particular or local church (diocese); 
and the liturgical (above all Eucharistic) assembly. The Church draws her life from the Word and 
the Body of Christ, and so herself becomes Christ’s Body (752). In the Creed, the sole Church of 
Christ is professed to be one, holy, catholic, and apostolic (811). 

CIRCUMCISION: The rite prescribed in Judaism and other cultures which involves cutting off 
the foreskin of a male. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and his people Israel 
and prefigured the rite of Christian initiation in Baptism. Jesus was circumcised eight days after his 
birth in accord with Jewish law (527). 



















COLLEGIALITY: The principle that all the bishops of the Church with the Pope at their head 
form a single “college,” which succeeds in every generation the “college” of the Twelve Apostles, 
with Peter at their head, which Christ instituted as the foundation of the Church. This college of 
bishops together with, but never without, the Pope has supreme and full authority over the universal 
Church (861, 880, 883). 

COMMANDMENT: A norm of moral and/or religious action; above all, the Ten Commandments 
given by God to Moses. Jesus summarized all the commandments in the twofold command of love 
of God and love of neighbor (2052). 

COMMANDMENTS OF THE CHURCH: See Precepts of the Church . 

COMMUNION: Holy Communion, the reception of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist 
(1382). More generally, our fellowship and union with Jesus and other baptized Christians in the 
Church, which has its source and summit in the celebration of the Eucharist. In this sense, Church 
as communion is the deepest vocation of the Church (959). 

COMMUNION OF SAINTS: The unity in Christ of all the redeemed, those on earth and those 
who have died. The communion of saints is professed in the Apostles’ Creed, where it has also 
been interpreted to refer to unity in the “holy things” (communio sanctorum ), especially the unity of 
faith and charity achieved through participation in the Eucharist (948, 957, 960, 1474 1 

CONCUPISCENCE: Human appetites or desires which remain disordered due to the temporal 
consequences of original sin, which remain even after Baptism, and which produce an inclination to 
sin 1 1264 . 1426 . 2515 1 

CONFESSION: An essential element of the Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation, which 
consists in telling one’s sins to the priestly minister. By extension, the word confession is used to 
refer to the Sacrament of Penance itself ( 1455 1 

CONFIRMATION: One of the ensemble of the Sacraments of Initiation into the Church, together 
with Baptism and Eucharist. Confirmation completes the grace of Baptism by a special outpouring 
of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which seal or “confirm” the baptized in union with Christ and equip 
them for active participation in the worship and apostolic life of the Church ( 1285 1 

CONSCIENCE: The interior voice of a human being, within whose heart the inner law of God is 
inscribed. Moral conscience is a judgment of practical reason about the moral quality of a human 


















action. It moves a person at the appropriate moment to do good and to avoid evil (1777-1778 ). An 
examination of conscience is recommended as a preparation for the reception of the Sacrament of 
Penance (1454). 

CONSECRATED LIFE: A permanent state of life recognized by the Church, entered freely in 
response to the call of Christ to perfection, and characterized by the profession of the evangelical 
counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience (914). See Vow . 

CONSECRATED VIRGINS: Women who have decided with the Church’s approval to cling only 
to the Lord and to live in a state of virginity “for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” and are 
consecrated in that state by a solemn rite ( 922-924 1. 

CONSECRATION: The dedication of a thing or person to divine service by a prayer or blessing. 
The consecration at Mass is that part of the Eucharistic Prayer during which the Lord’s words of 
institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper are recited by the priestly minister, making Christ’s 
Body and Blood—his sacrifice offered on the cross once for all—sacramentally present under the 
species of bread and wine ( 1352 . 1353 1. 

CONTEMPLATION: A form of wordless prayer in which mind and heart focus on God’s 
greatness and goodness in affective, loving adoration; to look on Jesus and the mysteries of his life 
with faith and love ( 2628 . 2715 1. 

CONTRACEPTION, ARTIFICIAL: The use of mechanical, chemical, or medical procedures to 
prevent conception from taking place as a result of sexual intercourse; contraception offends 
against the openness to procreation required of marriage and also the inner truth of conjugal love 
( 2370 1. 

CONTRITION: Sorrow of the soul and hatred for the sin committed, together with a resolution 
not to sin again. Contrition is the most important act of the penitent, and is necessary for the 
reception of the Sacrament of Penance ( 1451 1. 

CONVERSION: A radical reorientation of the whole life away from sin and evil, and toward God. 
This change of heart or conversion is a central element of Christ’s preaching, of the Church’s 
ministry of evangelization, and of the Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation ( 1427 . 1431 . 1423 : 
cf. 821 1. 


COUNCIL, ECUMENICAL: A gathering of all the bishops of the world, in the exercise of their 

















collegial authority over the universal Church. An ecumenical council is usually called by the 
successor of St. Peter, the Pope, or at least confirmed or accepted by him 18841. 


COUNSEL: See Evangelical Counsels : Gifts of the Holy Spirit . 

COVENANT: A solemn agreement between human beings or between God and a human being 
involving mutual commitments or guarantees. The Bible refers to God’s covenants with Noah, 
Abraham, and Moses as leader of the chosen people, Israel. In the Old Testament or Covenant, God 
revealed his law through Moses and prepared his people for salvation through the prophets. In the 
New Testament or Covenant, Christ established a new and eternal covenant through his own 
sacrificial death and Resurrection. The Christian economy is the new and definitive Covenant 
which will never pass away, and no new public revelation is to be expected before the glorious 
manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ (56, 62, 66). See Old Testament : New Testament . 

COVETOUSNESS: A disordered inclination or desire for pleasure or possessions. One of the 
capital sins, it is proscribed by the ninth and tenth commandments 1 2514 . 2534 1. 

CREATION: The act by which the eternal God gave a beginning to all that exists outside of 
himself. Creation also refers to the created universe or totality of what exists, as often expressed by 
the formula “the heavens and the earth” ( 290 ). 

CREED: A brief, normative summary statement or profession of Christian faith, e.g., the Apostles’ 
Creed, the Nicene Creed. The word “Creed” comes from the Latin Credo, meaning “I believe,” 
with which the Creed begins. Creeds are also called Symbols of Laith (1871. 

CROSS: The instrument of execution on which Christ died; a symbol of the unique sacrifice of 
Christ as sole mediator between God and man. Jesus invited his disciples to take up their cross and 
follow him, in order to associate with his redeeming sacrifice those who were to be its first 
beneficiaries. Catholics begin their prayers and actions with the Sign of the Cross “in the name of 
the Lather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.” A devotional cross with the figure of 
Jesus suspended on it is called a “crucifix” (616, 618, 2166 1. 

-D- 

DEACON, DIACONATE: A third degree of the hierarchy of the Sacrament of Holy Orders, after 
bishop and priest. The deacon is ordained not to priesthood but for ministry and service. Deacons 
are ordained to assist the bishop and priests in the celebration of the divine mysteries, above all the 














Eucharist, in the distribution of Holy Communion, in assisting at and blessing marriages, in the 
proclamation of the Gospel and preaching, in presiding over funerals, and in dedicating themselves 
to the various ministries of charity. While the Churches of the East have always had a functioning 
order of deacons, in the West the permanent diaconate was reestablished by the Second Vatican 
Council &lt;1569 . 1571 1. 

DECALOGUE: The Ten Commandments (literally, “ten words”) given by God to Moses on Sinai. 
In order to be faithful to the teaching of Jesus, the Decalogue must be interpreted in the light of the 
great commandment of love of God and neighbor (2055, 2056 1. See Commandment . 

DEFINITION, DOGMATIC: A solemn declaration by an ecumenical council or by the Pope that 
a doctrine is revealed by God and must be believed by the universal Church; such definitions are 
called infallible, and must be adhered to with the obedience of faith 18911. 

DEMON: See Devil/Demon . 

DEPOSIT OF FAITH: The heritage of faith contained in Sacred Scripture and Tradition, handed 
on in the Church from the time of the Apostles, from which the Magisterium draws all that it 
proposes for belief as being divinely revealed (84; cf. 1202 1. 

DESCENT INTO HELL: An article in the Apostles’ Creed referring to the victory over death and 
sin which Christ won by being “raised from the dead.” Jesus, like all people, experienced death and 
in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead, where he descended as Savior, proclaiming 
the Gospel to the spirits imprisoned there in order to free the just ones who had gone before him 
(632). 

DESPAIR: The abandonment of hope in salvation and the forgiveness of sins 1 2091 1. 

DETRACTION: Disclosure of another’s faults and sins, without an objectively valid reason, to 
persons who did not know about them, thus causing unjust injury to that person’s reputation ( 2477 1. 

DEVELOPMENT, DOCTRINAL: Growth in the understanding of God’s revelation, which 
continues though the contemplation and study of believers, theological research, and the preaching 
of the Magisterium (94). 

DEVIL/DEMON: A fallen angel, who sinned against God by refusing to accept his reign. Satan or 
the devil, the Evil One, and the other demons were at first good angels, created naturally good, who 













became evil by their own doing (391, 1707 : cf. 2851). 


DIACONATE: See Deacon. Diaconate . 

DIOCESE: A “particular church,” a community of the faithful in communion of faith and 
sacraments whose bishop has been ordained in apostolic succession. A diocese is usually a 
determined geographic area; sometimes it may be constituted as a group of people of the same rite 
or language. In Eastern churches, an eparchy (833). 

DISCIPLE: Those who accepted Jesus’ message to follow him are called his disciples. Jesus 
associated his disciples with his own life, revealed the mystery of the Kingdom to the disciples and 
gave them a share in his mission, his joy, and his sufferings (767, 787 1. 

DIVINE OFFICE: The Liturgy of the Hours, the public prayer of the Church which sanctifies the 
whole course of the day and night. Christ thus continues his priestly work through the prayer of his 
priestly people (1174). 

DIVORCE: The claim that the indissoluble marriage bond validly entered into between a man and 
a woman is broken. A civil dissolution of the marriage contract (divorce) does not free persons 
from a valid marriage before God; remarriage would not be morally licit ( 2382 : cf. 1650 ). 

DOCTRINE/DOGMA: The revealed teachings of Christ which are proclaimed by the fullest 
extent of the exercise of the authority of the Church’s Magisterium. The faithful are obliged to 
believe the truths or dogmas contained in divine Revelation and defined by the Magisterium (88). 

DOXOLOGY: Christian prayer which gives praise and glory to God, often in a special way to the 
three divine persons of the Trinity. Liturgical prayers traditionally conclude with the doxology “to 
the Lather, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit”; the final doxology of the Lord’s Prayer renews the 
prayer’s first three petitions in the form of adoration and praise 1 2639 . 2855). 

-E- 

EASTER: The greatest and oldest Christian feast, which celebrates Christ’s Resurrection from the 
dead. Easter is the “feast of feasts,” the solemnity of solemnities, the “Great Sunday.” Christians 
prepare for it during Lent and Holy Week, and catechumens usually receive the Sacraments of 
Christian Initiation (Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist) at the Easter Vigil ( 1169 : cf. 647 1 


EASTERN CHURCHES: Churches of the East in union with Rome (the Western Church), but not 
















of Roman rite, with their own liturgical, theological, and administrative traditions, such as those of 
the Byzantine, Alexandrian or Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, Maronite, and Chaldean rites. The variety 
of particular churches with dis- tinctive traditions witnesses to the catholicity of the one Church of 
Christ, which takes root in distinct cultures 1 1202-1203 : cf. 835). 

ECCLESIASTIC/ECCLESIASTICAL: Pertaining to or of the Church (Greek/Latin: ecclesia ). 
Hence ecclesiastical government is church government (857); an ecclesiastical province is a 
grouping of church jurisdictions or dioceses (887); an ecclesiastic is a church official. 

ECONOMY: The structure and organization of productive work or activity in a society, forming 
the basis for financial support and stability of individuals, families, and society. The morality of 
economic activity is judged according to the seventh commandment; economic activity is one of 
the principal points addressed by the Church’s social doctrine ( 2426 . 2430 1. 

ECONOMY OF SALVATION (DIVINE ECONOMY): From a Greek word ( oikonomia , 
literally “management of a household” or “stewardship”) which refers to God’s revelation and 
communication of himself to the world in time for the sake of the salvation of all humanity; hence, 
the economy of salvation ( 258 . 1066 1. The Fathers of the Church distinguished oikonomia from 
theologia; the latter term refers to the mystery of the internal life of the Trinity (236). The economy 
of salvation, on the other hand, refers to God’s activity in creating and governing the world, 
particularly with regard to his plan for the salvation of the world in the person and work of Jesus 
Christ, a plan which is being accomplished through his Body the Church, in its life and sacraments; 
hence, the “sacramental economy” ( 1076 . 1093 1. 

ECUMENICAL COUNCIL: See Council. Ecumenical . 

ECUMENISM: Promotion of the restoration of unity among all Christians, the unity which is a 
gift of Christ and to which the Church is called by the Holy Spirit. For the Catholic Church, the 
Decree on Ecumenism of the Second Vatican Council provides a charter for ecumenical efforts 
( 816 . 820-822 1. 

ENCYCLICAL: A pastoral letter written by the Pope and sent to the whole Church and even to 
the whole world, to express Church teaching on some important matter. Encyclicals are expressions 
of the ordinary papal magisterium (cf. 892 1. 

ENVY: Resentment or sadness at another’s good fortune, and the desire to have it for oneself. One 
of the seven capital sins, envy is contrary to the tenth commandment ( 2539 1. 


















EPARCHY: See Diocese. 


EPICLESIS: The prayer petitioning God to send the Holy Spirit so that the offerings at the 
Eucharist may become the Body and Blood of Christ and thus the faithful, by receiving them, may 
themselves become a living offering to God. In every sacrament, the prayer asking for the 
sanctifying power of God’s Holy Spirit is an “epiclesis” 1 1105 . 1127 1. 

EPIPHANY : The feast which celebrates the manifestation to the world of the newborn Christ as 
Messiah, Son of God, and Savior of the world. The feast of Epiphany celebrates the adoration of 
Jesus by the wise men (magi) from the East, together with his baptism in the Jordan and the 
wedding feast of Cana in Galilee (528; cf. 535 1. 

EPISCOPAL/EPISCOPATE: Pertaining to the office of bishop (Greek: episkopos), hence 
episcopal consecration, the episcopal college, episcopal conferences (883, 887, 1557 1. “Episcopate” 
is a collective noun referring to all those who have received sacramental ordination as bishops. 

EREMITICAL LIFE: The life of a hermit, separate from the world in praise of God and for the 
salvation of the world, in the silence of solitude, assiduous prayer, and penance 19201. 

ESCHATOLOGY: From the Greek word eschaton, meaning “last.” Eschatology refers to the area 
of Christian faith which is concerned about “the last things,” and the coming of Jesus on “the last 
day”: our human destiny, death, judgment, resurrection of the body, heaven, purgatory, and hell— 
all of which are contained in the final articles of the Creed ( 1001 . 1020-1050 : cf. 2771 1. 

ETERNAL LIFE: Living forever with God in the happiness of heaven, entered after death by the 
souls of those who die in the grace and friendship of God (988, 1020 1. In preaching the kingdom of 
heaven, Jesus called all people to eternal life, which is anticipated in the grace of union with Christ: 
“This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have 
sent” (Jn 17:3). 

EUCHARIST: The ritual, sacramental action of thanksgiving to God which constitutes the 
principal Christian liturgical celebration of and communion in the paschal mystery of Christ. The 
liturgical action called the Eucharist is also traditionally known as the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. It 
is one of the seven sacraments of the Church; the Holy Eucharist completes Christian initiation 
( 1322 ff.). The Sunday celebration of the Eucharist is at the heart of the Church’s life ( 2177 ). See 
Mass. 



















EUCHARISTIC PRAYER: See Canon of the Mass. 


EUTHANASIA: An action or an omission which, of itself or by intention, causes the death of 
handicapped, sick, or dying persons—sometimes with an attempt to justify the act as a means of 
eliminating suffering. Euthanasia violates the fifth commandment of the law of God ( 2277 ). 

EVANGELICAL COUNSELS: In general, the teachings of the New Law proposed by Jesus to 
his disciples which lead to the perfection of Christian life. In the New Law, the precepts are 
intended to remove whatever is incompatible with charity; the evangelical counsels are to remove 
whatever might hinder the development of charity, even if not contrary to it ( 1973 ). The public 
profession of the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience is a constitutive element 
of state of consecrated life in the Church (9151. 

EVANGELIST: One of the four authors to whom is ascribed the writing of the Gospels, i.e., 
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (125, 120). The term is also used for one who works actively to 
spread and promote the Christian faith. 

EVANGELIZATION: The proclamation of Christ and his Gospel (Greek: evangelion ) by word 
and the testimony of life, in fulfillment of Christ’s command (905; cf. 861 1 

EVE: According to the creation story in Genesis, the first woman; wife of Adam. God did not 
create man a solitary being; from the beginning, “male and female he created them” (Gen 1:29) 
1 369 . 375 1. Because she is the mother of the eternal Son of God made man, Jesus Christ the “new 
Adam,” Mary is called the “new Eve,” the “mother of the living” in the order of grace 1 511 1 See 
Adam . 

EVIL: The opposite or absence of good. One form of evil, physical evil, is a result of the “state of 
journeying” toward its ultimate perfection in which God created the world, involving the existence 
of the less perfect alongside the more perfect, the constructive and the destructive forces of nature, 
the appearance and disappearance of certain beings ( 310 ). Moral evil, however, results from the 
free choice to sin which angels and men have; it is permitted by God, who knows how to derive 
good from it, in order to respect the freedom of his creatures 1 311 1. The entire revelation of God’s 
goodness in Christ is a response to the existence of evil ( 309 . 385 . 1707 ). The devil is called the 
Evil One. See Devil/Demon. 


EXAMINATION OF CONSCIENCE: Prayerful self-reflection on our words and deeds in the 
light of the Gospel to determine how we may have sinned against God. The reception of the 




















Sacrament of Penance ought to be prepared for by such an examination of conscience ( 1454 ). 


EXCOMMUNICATION: A severe ecclesiastical penalty, resulting from grave crimes against the 
Catholic religion, imposed by ecclesiastical authority or incurred as a direct result of the 
commission of an offense. Excommunication excludes the offender from taking part in the 
Eucharist or other sacraments and from the exercise of any ecclesiastical office, ministry, or 
function (1463). 

EXODUS: God’s saving intervention in history by which he liberated the Hebrew people from 
slavery in Egypt, made a covenant with them, and brought them into the Promised Land. The Book 
of Exodus, the second of the Old Testament, narrates this saving history (62). The exodus is 
commemorated by the Jewish people at Passover, which for Christians is a foreshadowing of the 
“passover” of Jesus Christ from death to life and is celebrated in the memorial of the Eucharist 
(1363). 

EXORCISM: The public and authoritative act of the Church to protect or liberate a person or 
object from the power of the devil (e.g., demonic possession) in the name of Christ ( 1673 1 A 
simple exorcism prayer in preparation for Baptism invokes God’s help in overcoming the power of 
Satan and the spirit of evil ( 1237 ). 

EXPIATION: The act of redemption and atonement for sin which Christ won for us by the 
pouring out of his Blood on the cross, by his obedient love “even to the end” (Jn 13:1) (433, 616 . 
1475 1 The expiation of sins continues in the mystical body of Christ and the communion of saints 
by joining our human acts of atonement to the redemptive action of Christ, both in this life and in 
Purgatory. 

EXTREME UNCTION: See Anointing of the Sick . 

-F- 

FAITH: Both a gift of God and a human act by which the believer gives personal adherence to 
God who invites his response, and freely assents to the whole truth that God has revealed. It is this 
revelation of God which the Church proposes for our belief, and which we profess in the Creed, 
celebrate in the sacraments, live by right conduct that fulfills the twofold commandment of charity 
(as specified in the ten commandments), and respond to in our prayer of faith. Faith is both a 
theological virtue given by God as grace, and an obligation which flows from the first 
commandment of God (26, 142 . 150 . 1814 . 2087 1. 















FAITHFUL, THE CHRISTIAN: Those who have been incorporated into Christ in Baptism and 
constituted as the people of God, the Church (871). The term “lay faithful” refers to the laity, all the 
faithful except those in Holy Orders and those who belong to a religious state approved by the 
Church 18971. 

FALL: (1) Biblical revelation about the reality of sin in human history. The Biblical story begins 
with the original sin freely committed by the first human beings. This primeval event is narrated in 
figurative language in the Book of Genesis, which describes this sin as a “fall” from God’s 
friendship and grace, which they had received from God not only for themselves but for the whole 
human race (388, 390). (2) In the “fall” of angels, Scripture and Church tradition see the emergence 
of Satan and the “devil”; the “fall” of these angelic spirits was due to their freely chosen rejection 
of God and His reign 1 391-392 1. 

FASTING: Refraining from food and drink as an expression of interior penance, in imitation of the 
fast of Jesus for forty days in the desert. Fasting is an ascetical practice recommended in Scripture 
and the writings of the Church Fathers; it is sometimes prescribed by a precept of the Church, 
especially during the liturgical season of Lent 1 538 . 1434 . 2043 1. 

FATHER, GOD THE: God, the first Person of the Blessed Trinity. Jesus revealed that God is 
Father in a unique way: not only as Creator, the origin of all things, but also as eternal Father in his 
relationship to his only Son, who is eternally begotten of the Father and consubstantial with the 
Father (240, 242). 

FATHERS OF THE CHURCH: Church teachers and writers of the early centuries whose 
teachings are a witness to the Tradition of the Church (Z8, 688 1. 

FEAR OF THE LORD: One of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit which ensures our awe and 
reverence before God ( 1831 1. 

FEAST DAYS: The annual cycle of liturgical celebrations commemorating the saving mysteries of 
Christ’s life, as a participation in the Paschal Mystery, which is celebrated annually at Easter, the 
“Feast of feasts.” Feast days commemorating Mary, the Mother of God, and the saints are also 
celebrated, providing the faithful with examples of those who have been glorified with Christ 
1 1169 . 1173 1. 

FILIOQUE: A word meaning “and (from) the Son,” added to the Latin version of the Niceno- 
Constantinopolitan Creed, by which the Latin tradition of the Creed confesses that the Holy Spirit 
















“proceeds from the Father and the Son” (246). 


FORNICATION: Sexual intercourse between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman. 
Fornication is a serious violation of the sixth commandment of God (2353). 

FORTITUDE: One of the four cardinal moral virtues which ensures firmness in difficulties and 
constancy in doing the good (1808). Fortitude (sometimes called strength, courage, or might) is 
also one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit 1 1299 : cf. 712 1. 

FRUITS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: The perfections that the Holy Spirit forms in us as the “first 
fruits” of eternal glory. The tradition of the Church identifies twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit 
( 1832 1. 


-G- 

GENERAL CONFESSION AND ABSOLUTION: A communal form of the Sacrament of 
Penance in which, in a case of grave necessity, a priest may give absolution to all persons present at 
one time, after they have made a general, but not individual, confession of their sins. For the 
absolution to be valid, the faithful must have the intention of individually confessing their sins in 
their next individual reception of the Sacrament of Penance ( 1483 1. 

GENESIS: The first book of Bible, which describes God’s creation of the world and humanity, and 
the drama of sin and the hope for salvation ( 120 : cf. 289, 337, 355 1. 

GENUFLECTION: A reverence made by bending the knee, especially to express adoration of the 
Blessed Sacrament ( 1378 1. 

GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: Permanent dispositions that make us docile to follow the 
promptings of the Holy Spirit. The traditional list of seven gifts of the Spirit is derived from Isaiah 
11:1-3: wisdom, understanding, knowledge, counsel, piety, fortitude, and fear of the Lord ( 1830 1. 

GLUTTONY: Overindulgence in food or drink. Gluttony is one of the seven capital sins ( 1866 1. 

GOD: The infinite divine being, one in being yet three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God 
has revealed himself as the “One who is,” as truth and love, as creator of all that is, as the author of 
divine revelation, and as the source of salvation ( 198 . 279 1. 


GODPARENT: The sponsor of one who is baptized, who assumes a responsibility to assist the 


















newly-baptized—child or adult—on the road of Christian life (1255). 


GOSPEL: The “good news” of God’s mercy and love revealed in the life, death, and resurrection 
of Christ. It is this Gospel or good news that the Apostles, and the Church following them, are to 
proclaim to the entire world ( 571 . 1964 ). The Gospel is handed on in the apostolic tradition of the 
Church as the source of all-saving truth and moral discipline (75). The four Gospels are the books 
written by the evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John which have for their central object Jesus 
Christ, God’s incarnate Son: his life, teachings, Passion and glorification, and his Church’s 
beginnings under the Spirit’s guidance ( 124 . 514 1. 

GOSPEL, LAW OP THE: The New Law, prepared for by the Old Law in the time of the Old 
Covenant, is the perfection here on earth of the divine law, natural and revealed. It is the work of 
Christ, expressed particularly in the Sermon on the Mount, and of the Holy Spirit, by whose grace it 
becomes for us the interior law of charity ( 1965 1. 

GRACE: The free and undeserved gift that God gives us to respond to our vocation to become his 
adopted children. As sanctifying grace, God shares his divine life and friendship with us in a 
habitual gift, a stable and supernatural disposition that enables the soul to live with God, to act by 
his love. As actual grace, God gives us the help to conform our lives to his will. Sacramental grace 
and special graces (charisms, the grace of one’s state of life) are gifts of the Holy Spirit to help us 
live out our Christian vocation ( 1996 . 2000 : cf. 654 ). 

GUARDIAN ANGELS: Angels assigned to protect and intercede for each person (336). See 
Angel . 


MI¬ 
HAIL MARY: The prayer known in Latin as the Ave Maria. The first part of the prayer praises 
God for the gifts he gave to Mary as Mother of the Redeemer; the second part seeks her maternal 
intercession for the members of the Body of Christ, the Church, of which she is the Mother ( 2676 ). 

HAPPINESS: Joy and beatitude over receiving the fulfillment of our vocation as creatures: a 
sharing in the divine nature and the vision of God. God put us into the world to know, love, and 
serve him, and so come to the happiness of paradise ( 1720 1. 


HEAVEN: Eternal life with God; communion of life and love with the Trinity and all the blessed. 
Heaven is the state of supreme and definitive happiness, the goal of the deepest longings of 















humanity (1023). 


HELL: The state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed, reserved 
for those who refuse by their own free choice to believe and be converted from sin, even to the end 
of their lives (1033). 

HERESY: The obstinate denial after Baptism of a truth which must be believed with divine and 
Catholic faith (2089; cf. 465). 

HERMIT: One who lives the eremitical life. Through silence and solitude, in prayer and penance, 
the hermit or anchorite vows, although not necessarily publicly, to follow the evangelical counsels 
out of love for God and desire for the salvation of the world (920). 

HIERARCHY: The Apostles and their successors, the college of bishops, to whom Christ gave the 
authority to teach, sanctify, and rule the Church in his name ( 873 ). 

HIERARCHY OF TRUTHS: The order (hierarchy) of the truths in Catholic doctrine, insofar as 
they vary in their relation to the central mystery and foundation of Christian faith, the mystery of 
the Holy Trinity (90, 234)- 

HOLY DAYS OF OBLIGATION: Principal feast days on which, in addition to Sundays, 
Catholics are obliged by Church law to participate in the Eucharist; a precept of the Church ( 2043 . 
2180). 

HOLY ORDERS: See Orders. Holy 

HOLY SEE: The seat of the central administration of the worldwide Catholic Church; the name is 
taken from the seat or diocese of the Pope, Bishop of Rome and successor of St. Peter as Vicar of 
Christ and pastor of the universal Church (cf. 882). 

HOLY SPIRIT: The third divine Person of the Blessed Trinity, the personal love of Father and 
Son for each other. Also called the Paraclete (Advocate) and Spirit of Truth, the Holy Spirit is at 
work with the Father and the Son from the beginning to the completion of the divine plan for our 
salvation (685; cf. 152, 243). 

HOLY WATER: Blessed water, a sacramental whose sprinkling or use is a reminder of Baptism 
and a means of sanctification (1668). 

















HOLY WEEK: The week preceding Easter, beginning with Palm (Passion) Sunday, called the 
“Great Week” in the liturgies of the Eastern Churches. It marks the Church’s annual celebration of 
the events of Christ’s Passion, death, and Resurrection, culminating in the Paschal Mystery ( 1169 1. 

HOMILY : Preaching by an ordained minister to explain the Scriptures proclaimed in the liturgy 
and to exhort the people to accept them as the Word of God ( 132 . 1100 . 1349 1. 

HOMOSEXUALITY: Sexual attraction or orientation toward persons of the same sex and/or 
sexual acts between persons of the same sex. Homosexual acts are morally wrong because they 
violate God’s purpose for human sexual activity ( 2357 1. 

HOPE: The theological virtue by which we desire and expect from God both eternal life and the 
grace we need to attain it 1 1817 1. 

HUMILITY: The virtue by which a Christian acknowledges that God is the author of all good. 
Humility avoids inordinate ambition or pride, and provides the foundation for turning to God in 
prayer 1 2559 1. Voluntary humility can be described as “poverty of spirit” 1 2546 1. 

HYMN: Sacred poetry set to music and meant to raise the hearts of Christian people to God, 
especially during liturgical services 1 1156 1. 

HYPOSTATIC UNION: The union of the divine and human natures in the one divine Person 
(Greek: hypostasis ) of the Son of God, Jesus Christ (252, 468 1. 

-I- 

ICON: Religious painting traditional among many Eastern Christians. Christian iconography 
expresses in images the same Gospel message that Scripture communicates by words 1 1160 1. 

ICONOCLASM: A heresy which maintained that veneration of religious images is unlawful. 
Iconoclasm was condemned as unfaithful to Christian tradition at the Second Ecumenical Council 
of Nicaea in 787 A.D. 1 2131 1. 

IDOLATRY: The divinization of a creature in place of God; the substitution of some one (or 
thing) for God; worshiping a creature (even money, pleasure, or power) instead of the Creator 
1 2112 1 . 


IMMACULATE CONCEPTION: The dogma proclaimed in Christian Tradition and defined in 
















1854 . that from the first moment of her conception, Mary—by the singular grace of God and by 
virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ—was preserved immune from original sin (491). 

IMMORTALITY: The quality of the spiritual human soul whereby it survives the death of the 
body and remains in existence without end, to be reunited with the body at the final resurrection 
(366). 

IMPEDIMENT: An obstacle that makes a person ineligible for performing an act or receiving a 
sacrament, e.g., Holy Orders or Matrimony (cf. 1635 1. 

INCARNATION: The fact that the Son of God assumed human nature and became man in order 
to accomplish our salvation in that same human nature. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the second 
Person of the Trinity, is both true God and true man, not part God and part man (461, 464). 

INCREDULITY: The willful refusal to assent to revealed truth, or even the neglect of this truth 
(2089). 

INDULGENCE: The remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sin whose guilt has 
already been forgiven. A properly disposed member of the Christian faithful can obtain an 
indulgence under prescribed conditions through the help of the Church which, as the minister of 
redemption, dispenses and applies with authority the treasury of the satisfactions of Christ and the 
saints. An indulgence is partial if it removes part of the temporal punishment due to sin, or plenary 
if it removes all punishment (1471). 

INERRANCY: The attribute of the books of Scripture whereby they faithfully and without error 
teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to have confided through the 
Sacred Scriptures (107). 

INFALLIBILITY: The gift of the Holy Spirit to the Church whereby the pastors of the Church, 
the pope and bishops in union with him, can definitively proclaim a doctrine of faith or morals for 
the belief of the faithful 1 891 1 This gift is related to the inability of the whole body of the faithful 
to err in matters of faith and morals (92). 

INITIATION, CHRISTIAN: The foundations of every Christian life laid by the Sacraments of 
Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist. The process by which a non-baptized person is prepared to 
become a full member of the Church is called the catechumenate, which was restored in the Latin 
Church by the Second Vatican Council, and whose distinct stages and rites are found in the Rite of 












Christian Initiation of Adults ( 1212 . 1230 1 


INSPIRATION: See Biblical Inspiration . 

INSTITUTE, RELIGIOUS: A society whose members, in accord with Church law, live a life 
consecrated to Christ and shared with one another by the public profession of the evangelical 
counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience (925). See Consecrated Life . 

INSTITUTE, SECULAR: A form of consecrated life in which the Christian faithful living in the 
world strive for the perfection of charity and work for the sanctification of the world especially 
from within ( 928 1 

INTERCESSION: A form of prayer of petition on behalf of others. The prayer of intercession 
leads us to pray as Christ, our unique Intercessor, prayed ( 2634 1 

INTERCOMMUNION: Participation or sharing in the reception of the Eucharist or Holy 
Communion by Christians who are not fully united to or in full communion with the Catholic 
Church ( 1398 1 

IRRELIGION: A vice contrary by defect to the virtue of religion. Irreligion directs us away from 
rendering to God what we as creatures owe him in justice ( 2095 . 2110 1. 

ISRAEL: The Jewish people, chosen by God to be his people and named after Israel (Jacob), from 
whose twelve sons the tribes of Israel descend. God formed Israel into his priestly people in their 
exodus from the slavery of Egypt, when he made the first or Old Covenant with them and gave 
them his Law through Moses (62). 


-J- 

JESUS CHRIST: The eternal Son of God, who was born of the Virgin Mary, suffered crucifixion 
and death, rose from the dead and ascended into heaven, and will come again in glory to judge the 
living and the dead. “Jesus,” which means “God saves” in Hebrew, was the name given to him at 
the Annunciation; “Christ” is a title which comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew 
Messiah and means “anointed” ( 184 f.; 430 . 436 : cf. 727 1. 

JOHN THE BAPTIST: The immediate precursor or herald of Jesus. John identified Jesus as the 
Messianic Lamb of God and baptized him in the Jordan River. With prophetic power, John gave 
witness to Jesus by his preaching, by the baptism of conversion he announced, and finally by his 
















martyrdom ( 523 . 720). 


JUDGMENT: The eternal retribution received by each soul at the moment of death, in accordance 
with that person’s faith and works (“the particular judgment”) ( 1021-1022 1. The “Last Judgment” 
is God’s triumph over the revolt of evil, after the final cosmic upheaval of this passing world. 
Preceded by the resurrection of the dead, it will coincide with the second coming of Christ in glory 
at the end of time, disclose good and evil, and reveal the meaning of salvation history and the 
providence of God by which justice has triumphed over evil ( 677-679 . 1021 . 1038 1. 

JUDGMENT, RASH: A fault against the eighth commandment committed by one who assumes 
the moral fault of the neighbor to be true without sufficient foundation (2477). 

JUSTICE: The cardinal moral virtue which consists in the constant and firm will to give their due 
to God and to neighbor ( 1807 1. Original justice refers to the state of holiness in which God created 
our first parents (3751. Commutative justice, which obliges respect for the rights of the other, is 
required by the seventh commandment; it is distinguished from legal justice, which concerns what 
the citizen owes to the community, and distributive justice, which regulates what the community 
owes its citizens in proportion to their contributions and needs ( 2411 1. See Social Justice . 

JUSTIFICATION: The gracious action of God which frees us from sin and communicates “the 
righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ” (Rom 3:22). Justification is not only the 
remission of sins, but also the sanctification and renewal of the interior man ( 1987-1989 1. 

-K- 

KINGDOM OF GOD (OF HEAVEN): The reign or rule of God: “the kingdom of God is... 
righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Rom 14:17). The Kingdom of God draws near 
in the coming of the Incarnate Word; it is announced in the Gospel; it is the messianic King- dom, 
present in the person of Jesus, the Messiah; it remains in our midst in the Eucharist. Christ gave to 
his Apostles the work of proclaiming the Kingdom, and through the Holy Spirit forms his people 
into a priestly kingdom, the Church, in which the Kingdom of God is mysteriously present, for she 
is the seed and beginning of the Kingdom on earth. In the Lord’s Prayer (“Thy Kingdom come”) 
we pray for its final glorious appearance, when Christ will hand over the Kingdom to his Father 
( 541-554 . 709 . 763 . 2816 . 2819 1. 


-L- 



















LAITY : The faithful who, having been incorporated into Christ through Baptism, are made part of 
the people of God, the Church. The laity participate in their own way in the priestly, prophetic, and 
kingly functions of Christ. Laity are distinguished from clergy (who have received Holy Orders) 
and those in consecrated life (897). 

LAST JUDGMENT: See Judgment . 

LAST SUPPER: The last meal, a Passover supper, which Jesus ate with his disciples the night 
before he died. Jesus’ passing over to his Father by his death and Resurrection, the new Passover, is 
anticipated in the Last Supper and celebrated in the Eucharist, which fulfills the Jewish Passover 
and anticipates the final Passover of the Church in the glory of the kingdom. Hence the Eucharist is 
called “the Lord’s Supper” 1 610-611 . 1329 . 1340 ). 

LATIN RITE: The traditions of liturgy, laws, and practice in the Church in the West, as distinct 
from the rites and practices of the churches of the East ( 1203 ). 

LAW, MORAL: A rule of conduct established by competent authority for the common good. In 
biblical terms, the moral law is the fatherly instruction of God, setting forth the ways which lead to 
happiness and proscribing those which lead to evil. The divine or eternal law can be either natural 
or revealed (positive ). Natural moral law is inscribed in the heart, and known by human reason. 
Revealed law is found in the ancient law (Old Testament), notably the ten commandments, and in 
the new law (Law of the Gospel), the teaching of Christ, notably the Sermon on the Mount, which 
perfects the ancient law ( 1950-1974 ). 

LECTIONARY/LECTOR: The official, liturgical book ( lectionary ) from which the reader 
(lector ) proclaims the Scripture readings used in the Liturgy of the Word ( 1154 ). 

LENT: The liturgical season of forty days which begins with Ash Wednesday and ends with the 
celebration of the Paschal Mystery (Easter Triduum). Lent is the primary penitential season in the 
Church’s liturgical year, reflecting the forty days Jesus spent in the desert in fasting and prayer 
(540, 1095, 1438 ). 

LIFE: Both God’s gift of created human life and His divine life given to us as sanctifying grace. 
Beyond its ordinary meaning of human life, Jesus used “life” to signify a share in his own divine 
Trinitarian existence, which becomes possible for those who respond to his invitation to turn away 
from sin and open their hearts to God’s abiding love. Eternal life signifies that this gift will last 
forever in the blessedness of heaven. This gift of God begins with the “life” of faith and “new life” 













of Baptism (1225), is communicated in sanctifying grace ( 1997 ). and reaches perfection in the 
communion of life and love with the Holy Trinity in heaven (1023). 

LITURGICAL YEAR: The celebration throughout the year of the mysteries of the Lord’s birth, 
life, death, and Resurrection in such a way that the entire year becomes a “year of the Lord’s 
grace.” Thus the cycle of the liturgical year and the great feasts constitute the basic rhythm of the 
Christian’s life of prayer, with its focal point at Easter ( 1168 1 

LITURGY : In its original meaning, a “public work” or service done in the name of or on behalf of 
the people. Through the liturgy Christ our High Priest continues the work of our redemption 
through the Church’s celebration of the Paschal Mystery by which he accomplished our salvation 
1 1067-1069 1 

LORD: The Old Testament title for God that in speaking or reading aloud was always substituted 
for the name that was revealed to Moses and that was too holy to be pronounced: Yahweh. The 
New Testament uses this title both of God the Father and—in a new way—of Jesus, the incarnate 
Word (209, 446 1 

LORD’S PRAYER: The title early Christians gave to the prayer which Jesus entrusted to his 
disciples and to the Church (Mt 6:9-13). This fundamental Christian prayer is also called the “Our 
Father,” which are its first words 12759 1 

LOVE: See Charity . 


-M- 

MAGI: The wise men who came from the East to pay homage to the newborn Savior ( 528 1. 

MAGISTERIUM: The living, teaching office of the Church, whose task it is to give as authentic 
interpretation of the word of God, whether in its written form (Sacred Scripture), or in the form of 
Tradition. The Magisterium ensures the Church’s fidelity to the teaching of the Apostles in matters 
of faith and morals (85, 890, 2033 1. 

MARKS (NOTES) OF THE CHURCH: The four attributes (marks or notes) of the Church 
mentioned in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan creed: “We believe in one, holy, catholic, and 
apostolic Church” (8111 


MARRIAGE: A covenant or partnership of life between a man and woman, which is ordered to 















the well-being of the spouses and to the procreation and upbringing of children. When validly 
contracted between two baptized people, marriage is a sacrament (Matrimony) (1601). 

MARTYR: A witness to the truth of the faith, in which the martyr endures even death to be faithful 
to Christ. Those who die for the faith before having received Baptism are said to have received a 
“baptism of blood,” by which their sins are forgiven and they share in the death and Resurrection of 
Christ ( 1258 . 2473 1. 

MARY: The mother of Jesus. Because she is the mother of Jesus—Son of God and second Person 
of the Blessed Trinity—according to the flesh, she is rightly called the Mother of God ( Theotokos ) 
( 148 . 495 1. Mary is also called “full of grace,” and “Mother of the Church,” and in Christian prayer 
and devotion, “Our Lady,” the “Blessed Virgin Mary,” and the “New Eve” ( 722 . 726 . 963 1. See 
Virgin Mary . 

MASS: The Eucharist or principal sacramental celebration of the Church, established by Jesus at 
the Last Supper, in which the mystery of our salvation through participation in the sacrificial death 
and glorious Resurrection of Christ is renewed and accomplished. The Mass renews the paschal 
sacrifice of Christ as the sacrifice offered by the Church. It is called “Mass” (from the Latin missa ) 
because of the “mission” or “sending” with which the liturgical celebration concludes (Latin: “Ite, 
Missa est”) ( 1332 : cf. 1088 . 1382 . 2192 1. See Eucharist : Paschal Mystery/Sacrifice . 

MATRIMONY: See Marriage . 

MEDIATOR/MEDIATRIX: One who links or reconciles separate or opposing parties. Thus Jesus 
Christ is the “one mediator between God and the human race” (1 Tm 2:5). Through his sacrificial 
offering he has become high priest and unique mediator who has gained for us access to God’s 
saving grace for humanity. Moreover, Mary too is sometimes called Mediatrix in virtue of her 
cooperation in the saving mission of Christ, who alone is the unique mediator between God and 
humanity ( 618 . 1544 : cf. 970 1. 

MEDITATION: An exercise and a form of prayer in which we try to understand God’s revelation 
of the truths of faith and the purpose of the Christian life, and how it should be lived, in order to 
adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking ( 2705 1. 

MERCY: The loving kindness, compassion, or forbearance shown to one who offends (e.g., the 
mercy of God to us sinners) ( 1422 . 1829 1. See Works of Mercy . 

























MERIT: The reward which God promises and gives to those who love him and by his grace 
perform good works. One cannot “merit” justification or eternal life, which are the free gift of God; 
the source of any merit we have before God is due to the grace of Christ in us (2006). 

MESSIAH: A Hebrew word meaning “anointed” (436). See Christ : Jesus Christ . 

MINISTRY : The service or work of sanctification performed by the preaching of the word and the 
celebration of the sacraments by those in Holy Orders (893,1536), or in determined circumstances, 
by laity (903). The New Testament speaks of a variety of ministries in the Church; Christ himself is 
the source of ministry in the Church ( 873-874 ). Bishops, priests, and deacons are ordained 
ministers in the Church (1548). 

MIRACLE: A sign or wonder, such as a healing or the control of nature, which can only be 
attributed to divine power. The miracles of Jesus were messianic signs of the presence of God’s 
kingdom (547). 

MISSION: (1) Trinitarian missions: To accomplish the divine plan of the triune God for the 
redemption of humanity, the Son and the Holy Spirit were “sent” into the world: hence the 
Trinitarian “missions” (Latin missus means “sent”) (257, 689). (2) Apostolic mission: Just as he 
was sent by the Father, Jesus sent his Apostles into the world to continue his own saving mission 
(858). (3) Church as mission: Thus the Church is missionary by its very nature, continuing the 
mission or work of Christ through the Holy Spirit, according to the plan of God. This apostolic 
mission of the Church is fulfilled according to their different states of life by the clergy, laity, and 
religious 1 849 . 863 . 913). Missionary activity is sometimes given in a more specific sense as the 
work of initial evangelization and establishment of the Church in non-Christian lands. 

MONASTIC LIFE: Consecrated life marked by the public profession of religious vows of 
poverty, chastity, and obedience, and by a stable community life (in a monastery) with the 
celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours in choir (cf. 927). 

MORALITY: Referring to the goodness or evil of human acts. Human freedom makes a person a 
“moral subject” or agent, able to judge the morality (goodness or evil) of the acts which are chosen. 
The morality of human acts depends on the object (or nature) of the action, the intention or end 
foreseen, and the circumstances of the action 1 1749 : cf. 407). 

MORTAL SIN: A grave infraction of the law of God that destroys the divine life in the soul of the 
sinner (sanctifying grace), constituting a turn away from God. For a sin to be mortal, three 





















conditions must be present: grave matter, full knowledge of the evil of the act, and full consent of 
the will (1855, 1857 1 


MOSES: The leader chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of their exile in Egypt. To him God 
revealed the divine name (Yahweh) and the law on Mount Sinai (including the Decalogue), by 
which he sealed the covenant with his people Israel (62, 204). As lawgiver, Moses was a type of 
Christ, the lawgiver of the New Law. 

MYSTAGOGY: A liturgical catechesis which aims to initiate people into the mystery of Christ. In 
a more specific sense, the catechetical period following immediately after the reception of Baptism 
by adults ( 1075 ). 


-N- 

NATURE: The created order (341). Human nature, though wounded and weakened by the effects 
of original sin, continues to participate in the goodness of God’s creative work (405). Through the 
Incarnation the second Person of the Trinity assumed our human nature, taking flesh in the womb 
of the Virgin Mary (456). The divine nature refers to the one divine substance or essence; each of 
the three distinct Persons of the Trinity is entirely God, who is one by the divine nature 1 253 ). 

NEW COVENANT: The new “dispensation,” order or Covenant, established by God in Jesus 
Christ, to succeed and perfect the Old Covenant (cf. 612, 839). The New Law or Law of the Gospel 
is the perfection here on earth of the divine law, natural and revealed; this law of the New Covenant 
is called a law of love, grace, and freedom 1 1965-1972 ). See Covenant : Gospel. Law of the . 

NEW TESTAMENT: The twenty-seven books of the Bible written by the sacred authors in 
apostolic times, which have Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son of God—his life, teachings, Passion and 
glorification, and the beginnings of his Church—as their central theme. The promises and mighty 
deeds of God in the old alliance or covenant, reported in the Old Testament, prefigure and are 
fulfilled in the New Covenant established by Jesus Christ, reported in the sacred writings of the 
New Testament (124,128). See Bible : Covenant . 

NICENE CREED: The profession of faith, common to the churches of East and West, which came 
from the first two ecumenical councils (Nicaea and Constantinople: 325 and 381 A.D.) 1 195-196 ). 
See Creed. 


NUPTIAL BLESSING: Prayers for the blessing of a couple being married, especially of the bride 





















(1624). 


-O- 

OBEDIENCE: (1) The submission to the authority of God which requires everyone to obey the 
divine law. Obedience to the Church is required in those things which pertain to our salvation; and 
obedience is due to legitimate civil authority, which has its origin in God for the sake of the 
common good and the order of society ( 1897 1 The fourth commandment obliges children to obey 
their parents ( 2216 1 (2) Obedience of faith: The first obedience is that of faith: to listen and freely 
submit to the word of God (144). (3) Obedience of Christ: Jesus Christ substituted his obedience to 
the will of his Father, even unto death, for the disobedience of sin, in order to bring us the grace of 
justification and to satisfy for our sins (6151 (4) Vow of obedience: In imitation of this obedience 
of Jesus, as an evangelical counsel, the faithful may profess a vow of obedience; a public vow of 
obedience, accepted by Church authority, is one element that characterizes the consecrated life 
(915). 

OIKONOMIA: See Economy . 

OLD COVENANT: The old dispensation or order, which God established with his chosen people 
Israel, through the revelation of the Law to Moses ( 1961 ). See Covenant . 

OLD TESTAMENT: The forty-six books of the Bible, which record the history of salvation from 
creation through the old alliance or covenant with Israel, in preparation for the appearance of Christ 
as Savior of the world ( 120-121 1 See Bible : Covenant . 

ORDERS, HOLY : The Sacrament of Apostolic Ministry by which the mission entrusted by Christ 
to his Apostles continues to be exercised in the Church through the laying on of hands. This 
sacrament has three distinct degrees or “orders”: deacon, priest, and bishop. All three confer a 
permanent, sacramental character ( 1536 1 

ORDERS, RELIGIOUS: See Consecrated Life : Institute. Religious . 

ORDINATION: The rite of the Sacrament of Holy Orders by which the bishop, through the 
imposition of hands and the prayer of consecration, confers the order of bishop, priest, or deacon to 
exercise a sacred power which comes from Christ on behalf of the Church ( 1538 ). 


ORIGINAL SIN: The sin by which the first human beings disobeyed the commandment of God, 


















choosing to follow their own will rather than God’s will. As a consequence they lost the grace of 
original holiness, and became subject to the law of death; sin became universally present in the 
world. Besides the personal sin of Adam and Eve, original sin describes the fallen state of human 
nature which affects every person born into the world, and from which Christ, the “new Adam,” 
came to redeem us 1 396-412 1. 

ORTHODOX CHURCHES: Eastern Churches not in full communion with the Catholic Church. 
Christians of the Orthodox Churches are separated from the Catholic Church (schism), yet are in an 
imperfect but deep communion with the Catholic Church by reason of our common Baptism, the 
profession of the Creed, and the possession of true sacraments by reason of the apostolic succession 
of their priesthood 1 838 . 1399 1. 

OUR FATHER: See Lord’s Prayer . 

OUR LADY: See Mary . 


-P- 

PAPACY: The supreme jurisdiction and ministry of the pope as shepherd of the whole Church. As 
successor of St. Peter, and therefore Bishop of Rome and Vicar of Christ, the pope is the perpetual 
and visible principle of unity in faith and communion in the Church 1 882 1. See Pope . 

PARABLES: A characteristic feature of the teaching of Jesus. Parables are simple images or 
comparisons which confront the hearer or reader with a radical choice about his invitation to enter 
the Kingdom of God 15461. 

PARACLETE: A name for the Holy Spirit. The term was used by Jesus in the New Testament (cf. 
Jn 14:16) to indicate the promised gift of the Spirit as another consoler and advocate, who would 
continue his own mission among the disciples 1 692 1. 

PARADISE: The symbolic description of the condition of our first parents before the Fall, who 
lived in a state of friendship with God in the happiness of original justice and holiness (374, 384). 
Paradise also signifies heaven, the state of those who live with Christ forever in the friendship and 
presence of God 1 1023 . 1721 1. 


PARISH: A stable community of the faithful within a particular church or diocese, whose pastoral 
care is confided by the bishop to a priest as pastor 1 2179 1. 
















PAROUSIA: The glorious return and appearance of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as judge of 
the living and the dead, at the end of time; the second coming of Christ, when history and all 
creation will achieve their fulfillment ( 1001 : cf. 668, 673). 

PARTICULAR CHURCH: See Diocese . 

PASCH/PASCHAL LAMB: Jesus’ saving death and its memorial in the Eucharist, associated 
with the Jewish feast of Passover (or Pasch) commemorating the deliverance of the Jewish people 
from death by the blood of the lamb sprinkled on the doorposts in Egypt, which the angel of death 
saw and “passed over.” Hence Jesus is acknowledged in the New Testament as the Lamb of God, 
who takes away the sins of the world; he is the Paschal Lamb, the symbol of Israel’s redemption at 
the first Passover. The Eucharist celebrates the new Passover, in which Jesus “passes over” to his 
Father by his death and Resurrection, thus anticipating the final Passover of the Church in the glory 
of the Kingdom (571, 608, 671, 1334-1340 L 

PASCHAL MYSTERY/SACRIFICE: Christ’s work of redemption accomplished principally by 
his Passion, death, Resurrection, and glorious Ascension, whereby “dying he destroyed our death, 
rising he restored our life” (1067; cf. 654). The Paschal Mystery is celebrated and made present in 
the liturgy of the Church, and its saving effects are communicated through the sacraments (1076), 
especially the Eucharist, which renews the paschal sacrifice of Christ as the sacrifice offered by the 
Church (571, 1362-1372 1. 

PASSION: The suffering and death of Jesus ( 572 . 602-616 1 Passion or Palm Sunday begins Holy 
Week, during which the annual liturgical celebration of the Paschal Mystery of Christ takes place 
(560). 

PASSIONS, MORAL: The emotions or dispositions which incline us to good or evil actions, such 
as love and hate, hope and fear, joy and sadness, and anger ( 1763 1 

PASSOVER: See Pasch/Paschal Lamb . 

PASTOR/PASTORAL OFFICE: The ministry of shepherding the faithful in the name of Christ. 
The pope and bishops receive the pastoral office which they are to exercise with Christ the Good 
Shepherd as their model; they share their pastoral ministry with priests, to whom they give 
responsibility over a portion of the flock as pastors of parishes ( 886 . 1560 . 2179 ). 


PATRIARCH: A title given to the venerable ancestors or “fathers” of the Semitic peoples, 























Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who received God’s promise of election (61, 205). In the Church 
hierarchy, and especially among the Churches of the East, a patriarch is a senior bishop with 
jurisdiction over a larger unit of particular churches (patriarchate) of a certain rite or region or 
liturgical tradition 18871. 

PATRISTIC: Pertaining to the writings of the holy Fathers of the Church, who are privileged 
witnesses of the apostolic tradition (78, 688). See Fathers of the Church . 

PEACE: One of the fruits of the Holy Spirit mentioned in Galatians 5:22-23 (736). Peace is a goal 
of Christian living, as indicated by Jesus who said “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be 
called children of God” ( 1716 1. The Fifth Commandment requires us to preserve and work for 
peace, which was defined by St. Augustine as “the tranquility of order,” and which is the work of 
justice and the effect of charity ( 2304 1. 

PENANCE: Interior penance: a conversion of heart toward God and away from sin, which implies 
the intention to change one’s life because of hope in divine mercy ( 1431 1. External acts of penance 
include fasting, prayer, and almsgiving ( 1434 1. The observance of certain penitential practices is 
obliged by the fourth precept of the Church ( 2043 1. 

PENANCE, SACRAMENT OF: The liturgical celebration of God’s forgiveness of the sins of the 
penitent, who is thus reconciled with God and with the Church. The acts of the penitent— 
contrition, the confession of sins, and satisfaction or reparation—together with the prayer of 
absolution by the priest, constitute the essential elements of the Sacrament of Penance (980, 1422 . 
1440 . 1448 1. 

PENITENT/PENITENTIAL: The sinner who repents of sin and seeks forgiveness ( 1451 1. In the 
early Church, public sinners belonged to an “order of penitents,” who did public penance for their 
sins, often for years ( 1447 1. Penitential acts or practices refer to those which dispose one for or 
flows from interior penance or conversion; such acts lead to and follow upon the celebration of the 
Sacrament of Penance ( 1434 1. See Satisfaction (for sink 

PENTATEUCH: The first five books of the Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Feviticus, Numbers, 
and Deuteronomy (702; cf. 120 1. 

PENTECOST: The “fiftieth” day at the end of the seven weeks following Passover (Easter in the 
Christian dispensation). At the first Pentecost after the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus, the 
Holy Spirit was manifested, given and communicated as a divine Person to the Church, fulfilling 






















the paschal mystery of Christ according to his promise ( 726 . 731 : cf. 1287 1. Annually the Church 
celebrates the memory of the Pentecost event as the beginning of the new “age of the Church,” 
when Christ lives and acts in and with his Church ( 1076 1. 

PEOPLE OF GOD: A synonym for the Church, taken from the Old Testament people whom God 
chose, Israel. Christ instituted the new and eternal covenant by which a new priestly, prophetic, and 
royal People of God, the Church, participates in these offices of Christ and in the mission and 
service which flow from them ( 761 . 783 1. 

PERJURY: Giving one’s word under oath falsely, or making a promise under oath without 
intending to keep it. Perjury violates the second and eighth commandments ( 2152 . 2476 1. 

PERSON, DIVINE: Hypostasis in Greek; the term used to describe the Father, Son, and Holy 
Spirit in their real relation to and distinction from one another within the unity of the Blessed 
Trinity. Each of the three divine Persons is God (252). See Trinity . 

PERSON, HUMAN: The human individual, made in the image of God; not some thing but some 
one, a unity of spirit and matter, soul and body, capable of knowledge, self-possession, and 
freedom, who can enter into communion with other persons—and with God (357, 362; cf. 1700 1. 
The human person needs to live in society, which is a group of persons bound together organically 
by a principle of unity that goes beyond each one of them ( 1879 1. 

PETER, SAINT: Simon, whom Jesus called Peter or “Rock,” upon whom he would build his 
Church (Mi 16:16-19). He was the first to confess Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of the living God 
(442). He was the first among the Apostles, and their head; the pope is his successor as Bishop of 
Rome and Vicar of Christ, and as pastor of the universal Church (552 ff.; 765, 862, 881 1. 

PIETY: One of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit which leads one to devotion to God ( 1831 1. Filial 
piety connotes an attitude of reverence and respect by children toward their parents ( 2215 1. Piety 
also refers to the religious sense of a people, and its expression in popular devotions ( 1674 1. 

POLYGAMY: The practice of having more than one wife at the same time, which is contrary to 
the unity of marriage between one man and one woman, and which offends against the dignity of 
woman ( 1645 . 2387 1. 

POPE: The successor of St. Peter as Bishop of Rome and Supreme Pontiff of the universal 
Catholic Church. The pope exercises a primacy of authority as Vicar of Christ and shepherd of the 


























whole Church; he receives the divine assistance promised by Christ to the Church when he defines 
infallibly a doctrine of faith or morals ( 880-882 1. See Papacy . 

POVERTY: The condition of want experienced by those who are poor, whom Christ called 
“blessed,” and for whom he had a special love (544). In imitation of Christ, the Church expresses 
her concern for the poor by working for justice and solidarity ( 2443 1. Poverty is one of the three 
evangelical counsels whose public profession in the Church is a constitutive element of consecrated 
life ( 915 1. Poverty of spirit signifies detachment from worldly things and voluntary humility ( 2544- 
2546 1. 

PRAISE: The form of prayer which focuses on giving recognition to God for his own sake, giving 
glory to Him for who he is ( 2639 1. In the liturgy of the Eucharist, the whole Church joins with 
Christ in giving praise and thanksgiving to the Father ( 1358 1. See Doxologv . 

PRAYER: The elevation of the mind and heart to God in praise of his glory; a petition made to 
God for some desired good, or in thanksgiving for a good received, or in intercession for others 
before God. Through prayer the Christian experiences a communion with God through Christ in the 
Church ( 2559-2565 1. 

PRECEPTS OF THE CHURCH: Positive laws (sometimes called commandments) made by 
Church authorities to guarantee for the faithful the indispensable minimum in prayer and moral 
effort, for the sake of their growth in love of God and neighbor ( 2041 1. 

PRESBYTER: An “elder” or priest, a member of the order of priesthood; the presbyterate is one of 
the three degrees of the Sacrament of Holy Orders ( 1536 . 1554 1. Presbyters or priests are co¬ 
workers with their bishops and form a unique sacerdotal college or “presbyterium” dedicated to 
assist their bishops in priestly service to the People of God ( 1567 1. Through the ministry of priests, 
the unique sacrifice of Christ on the cross is made present in the Eucharistic sacrifice of the Church 
( 1554 . 1562 1. See Priesthood . 

PRESENTATION: The presentation and dedication of Jesus to God by Mary and Joseph in the 
Temple (Lk 2:22-39), in accord with Mosaic Law concerning the first-born. At the Presentation, 
Simeon and Anna sum up the expectation of Israel for the long-awaited Messiah, the light of the 
nations and the glory of Israel, but also as a sign of contradiction (529). The presentation of the 
gifts, especially of bread and wine, is a preparatory rite for the liturgy of the Eucharist at Mass 
( 1346 1. 






















PRESUMPTION: An act or attitude opposed to the theological virtue of hope. Presumption can 
take the form of trust in self without recognizing that salvation comes from God, or of an over- 
confidence in divine mercy (2092). 

PRIDE: One of the seven capital sins. Pride is undue self-esteem or self-love, which seeks 
attention and honor and sets oneself in competition with God (1866). 

PRIESTHOOD: (1) Of the faithful: The priestly people of God. Christ has made of his Church a 
“kingdom of priests,” and gives the faithful a share in his priesthood through the Sacraments of 
Baptism and Confirmation ( 784 . 1119 . 1546 ). (2) Ministerial: The ministerial priesthood received 
in the Sacrament of Holy Orders differs in essence from this common priesthood of all the faithful. 
It has as its purpose to serve the priesthood of all the faithful by building up and guiding the Church 
in the name of Christ, who is Head of the Body ( 1547 1 See Priesthood of Christ : Presbyter . 

PRIESTHOOD OF CHRIST: The unique high priest, according to the order of Melchizedek. 
Christ fulfilled everything that the priesthood of the Old Covenant prefigured, (cf. Heb 5:10, 6:20). 
He offered himself once and for all (Heb 10:14), in a perfect sacrifice upon the cross. His 
priesthood is made present in a special way in the Church through the ministerial priesthood, 
conferred through the Sacrament of Holy Orders ( 1539 . 1544 . 1547 . 1554 1 

PRIMACY: See Pope . 

PRIVATE REVELATIONS: Revelations made in the course of history which do not add to or 
form part of the deposit of faith, but rather may help people live out their faith more fully (67). 
Some of these private revelations have been recognized by the authority of the Church, which 
cannot accept so-called “revelations of faith” that claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of 
Christ confided to his Church. 

PROFESSION OF FAITH: The synthesis (creed, “symbol of faith”) of the faith which 
summarizes the faith professed by Christians (187). See Creed . 

PROPHET: One sent by God to form the people of the Old Covenant in the hope of salvation. The 
prophets are often authors of books of the Old Testament (ZQ2). The prophetic books constitute a 
major section of the Old Testament of the Bible (64, 120, 522, 2581 1. John the Baptist concludes 
the work of the prophets of the Old Covenant (721). 


PROTESTANT: A person who believes in Christ and has been baptized, but who does not profess 






















the Catholic faith in its entirety, but rather is a member of a Protestant church or ecclesial 
community whose roots are in the Reformation, begun in the sixteenth century (cf. 838). 

PROTO-EVANGELIUM: The proto- or “first” Gospel: the passage in Genesis (3:15) that first 
mysteriously announces the promise of the Messiah and Redeemer ( 410 1. 

PROVIDENCE: The dispositions by which God guides his creation toward its perfection yet to be 
attained; the protection and governance of God over all creation (302). 

PRUDENCE: The virtue which disposes a person to discern the good and choose the correct 
means to accomplish it. One of the cardinal moral virtues that dispose the Christian to live 
according to the law of Christ, prudence provides the proximate guidance for the judgment of 
conscience (1806). 

PSALM: A prayer in the Book of Psalms of the Old Testament, assembled over several centuries; a 
collection of prayers in the form of hymns or poetry. The psalms have been used since Jesus’ time 
as the public prayer of the Church (2585). 

PSALTER: The book of psalms arranged for liturgical use ( 2587 1. 

PUNISHMENT, ETERNAL: The penalty for unrepented mortal sin, separating the sinner from 
communion with God for all eternity; the condemnation of the unrepentant sinner to hell ( 1035 1. 

PUNISHMENT, TEMPORAL: Purification of the unhealthy attachment to creatures, which is a 
consequence of sin that perdures even after death. We must be purified either during our earthly life 
through prayer and a conversion which comes from fervent charity, or after death in purgatory 
( 1472 1. 

PURGATORY : A state of final purification after death and before entrance into heaven for those 
who died in God’s friendship, but were only imperfectly purified; a final cleansing of human 
imperfection before one is able to enter the joy of heaven ( 1031 : cf. 1472 1. 

-R- 

RACISM: Unjust discrimination on the basis of a person’s race; a violation of human dignity, and 
a sin against justice ( 1935 1. 


REAL PRESENCE: The unique, true presence of Christ in the Eucharist under the species or 













appearances of bread and wine. The Church invites the faithful to deepen their faith in the real 
presence of Christ through adoration and communion at the Eucharistic liturgy, and through 
adoration outside its celebration 1 1378-1379 1. 

RECONCILIATION, SACRAMENT OF: The sacramental celebration in which, through God’s 
mercy and forgiveness, the sinner is reconciled with God and also with the Church, Christ’s Body, 
which is wounded by sin 1 1422 . 1442-1445 . 1468 1. See Penance . 

REDEEMER/REDEMPTION: Jesus Christ, redeemer of mankind. Christ paid the price of his 
own sacrificial death on the cross to ransom us, to set us free from the slavery of sin, thus achieving 
our redemption 1 571 . 601 : cf. 517, 1372 1. 

RELIGION: A set of beliefs and practices followed by those committed to the service and worship 
of God. The first commandment requires us to believe in God, to worship and serve him, as the first 
duty of the virtue of religion 1 2084 . 2135 1. 

RELIGIOUS LIFE: See Consecrated Life . 

REMISSION OF SINS: The forgiveness of sins, which is accomplished in us through faith and 
Baptism, as the fruit of the redemptive sacrifice of Christ on the cross (976, 1263 1. Christ gave the 
power to remit sins to his Apostles, and through them to the ministers of the Church 1 981 1. The 
remission of sins committed after Baptism is effected sacramentally through the Sacrament of 
Penance and Reconciliation 1 1446 1. 

REPARATION: Making amends for a wrong done or for an offense, especially for sin, which is 
an offense against God. By his death on the cross, the Son of God offered his life out of love for the 
Father to make reparation for our sinful disobedience 1 614 1. We are obliged to make reparation for 
personal sins against justice and truth, either through restitution of stolen goods or correcting the 
harm done to the other’s good name 1 2412 . 2487 1. See Satisfaction If or sink 

REPENTANCE: See Contrition : Penance . 

RESTITUTION: The return of what has been unjustly taken from another 1 2409 . 2412 1. 

RESURRECTION OF CHRIST: The bodily rising of Jesus from the dead on the third day after 
his death on the cross and burial in the tomb. The Resurrection of Christ is the crowning truth of 
our faith in Christ 16381. 



























RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD: The raising of the righteous, who will live forever with the 
risen Christ, on the last day. The eleventh article of the Christian creed states, “I believe in the 
resurrection of the body.” The resurrection of the body means not only that the immortal soul will 
live on after death, but that even our “mortal bodies” (Rom 8:11) will come to life again (988). 

REVELATION: God’s communication of himself, by which he makes known the mystery of his 
divine plan, a gift of self-communication which is realized by deeds and words over time, and most 
fully by sending us his own divine Son, Jesus Christ (50). 

RITES: The diverse liturgical traditions in which the one catholic and apostolic faith has come to 
be expressed and celebrated in various cultures and lands; for example, in the West, the Roman and 
Ambrosian (Latin) rites; in the East, the Byzantine, Coptic (Alexandrian), Syriac, Armenian, 
Maronite, and Chaldean rites ( 1201-1203 1. “Rite” and “ritual” are sometimes interchanged, as in 
“the sacramental rite” or “the sacramental ritual.” 

ROSARY: A prayer in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which repeats the privileged Marian 
prayer Ave Maria, or Hail Mary, in “decades” of ten prayers, each preceded by the Pater Noster 
(“Our Father”) and concluded by the Gloria Patri (Glory Be to the Father), accompanied by 
meditation on the mysteries of Christ’s life. The rosary was developed by medieval piety in the 
Fatin church as a popular substitute for the liturgical prayer of the Hours 1 2678 . 2708 : cf. 1674 1. 

-S- 

SABBATH: The Sabbath or seventh “day,” on which God rested after the work of the “six days” 
of creation was completed, as recounted in the opening narrative of the Bible. Creation is thus 
ordered to the Sabbath, the day to be kept holy to the praise and worship of God. Just as the seventh 
day or Sabbath completes the first creation, so the “eighth day,” Sunday, the day of the week on 
which Jesus rose from the dead, is celebrated as the “holy day” by Christians—the day on which 
the “new creation” began 1 345-349 1. Thus the Christian observance of Sunday fulfills the 
commandment to remember and keep holy the Sabbath day 1 2175 1. 

SACRAMENT: An efficacious sign of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by 
which divine life is dispensed to us through the work of the Holy Spirit ( 774 . 1131 1. The 
sacraments (called “mysteries” in the Eastern Churches) are seven in number: Baptism, 
Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance or Reconciliation, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and 
Matrimony 11210 1. 












SACRAMENTALS: Sacred signs which bear a certain resemblance to the sacraments, and by 
means of which spiritual effects are signified and obtained through the prayers of the Church 
( 1667 ). 

SACRED HEART: The symbol of the love with which Jesus continually loves the eternal Father 
and all human beings without exception (478). 

SACRIFICE: A ritual offering made to God by a priest on behalf of the people, as a sign of 
adoration, gratitude, supplication, and communion (2099). The perfect sacrifice was Christ’s death 
on the cross; by this sacrifice, Christ accomplished our redemption as high priest of the new and 
eternal covenant (616). The sacrifice of Christ on the cross is commemorated and mysteriously 
made present in the Eucharistic sacrifice of the Church ( 1357 . 1544 1 

SACRILEGE: Profanation of or irreverence toward persons, places, and things which are sacred, 
i.e., dedicated to God; sacrilege against the sacraments, especially the Eucharist, is a particularly 
grave offense against the first commandment (2120). 

SAINT: The “holy one” who leads a life in union with God through the grace of Christ and 
receives the reward of eternal life. The Church is called the communion of saints, of the holy ones 
( 823 . 946 : cf. 828). See Canonization . 

SALVATION: The forgiveness of sins and restoration of friendship with God, which can be done 
by God alone (169). 

SANCTIFYING GRACE: The grace which heals our human nature wounded by sin by giving us 
a share in the divine life of the Trinity. It is a habitual, supernatural gift which continues the work 
of sanctifying us—of making us “perfect,” holy, and Christlike (1999). 

SANCTUARY: (1) The part of a church set apart for the principal rites of worship (cf. 1183 1 (2) 
A shrine or place of pilgrimage ( 1674 ). 

SATAN: A fallen angel or the devil; the Evil One (391, 395, 2851 1 

SATISFACTION (FOR SIN): An act whereby the sinner makes amends for sin, especially in 
reparation to God for offenses against him. The penance given by the confessor in the Sacrament of 
Penance constitutes such satisfaction. All true satisfaction for sin must be a participation in the 
satisfaction for sin made by Christ through his death on the cross ( 1459 1 See Penance : 






















Penitent/Penitential : Reparation . 


SAVIOR: Jesus (which means “God saves” in Hebrew). The Son of God became man to achieve 
our salvation; he is the unique savior of humanity (430). 

SCANDAL: An attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil ( 2284 1. 

SCHISM: Refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff, or of communion with the members of 
the Church subject to him ( 2089 1. 

SCRIPTURE, SACRED: The sacred writings of the Old and New Testaments (101)- See Bible . 

SEAL OF CONFESSION: The confessor’s obligation to keep absolutely secret what a penitent 
has told to him in the Sacrament of Penance; also known as the “sacramental seal” ( 1467 1. 

SECOND COMING OF CHRIST: See Parousia . 

SECULAR INSTITUTE: See Institute. Secular . 

SENSUS FIDEI: A supernatural appreciation of the faith (sensus fidei ) shown by the universal 
consent in matters of faith and morals manifested by the whole body of the faithful under the 
guidance of the Magisterium (92). 

SEPTUAGINT: A pre-Christian Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures made by Jewish 
scholars, and later adopted by Greek-speaking Christians (2131. 

SIGN OF THE CROSS: A sign in the form of a cross made by the Christian as a prayer honoring 
the Blessed Trinity, “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” ( 2157 : cf. 
786 1. 

SIMONY: The buying or selling of spiritual things, which have God alone as their owner and 
master ( 2121 1. 

SIN: An offense against God as well as a fault against reason, truth, and right conscience. Sin is a 
deliberate thought, word, deed, or omission contrary to the eternal law of God. In judging the 
gravity of sin, it is customary to distinguish between mortal and venial sins ( 1849 . 1853 . 1854 1. 


SLANDER: See Calumny . 




















SLOTH: A culpable lack of physical or spiritual effort; acedia or laziness. One of the capital sins 
( 1866 . 2094 . 2733 1. 


SOCIAL JUSTICE: The respect for the human person and the rights which flow from human 
dignity and guarantee it. Society must provide the conditions that allow people to obtain what is 
their due, according to their nature and vocation ( 1928 . 1931 1. 

SOCIAL SIN: The effect of sin over time, which can affect society and its institutions to create 
“structures of sin,” by analogy called “social sin” ( 1869 1. 

SOCIAL TEACHING: The teaching (social doctrine) of the Church on the truth of revelation 
about human dignity, human solidarity, and the principles of justice and peace; the moral 
judgments about economic and social matters required by such truth and about the demands of 
justice and peace ( 2419-2422 1. 

SON OF GOD: A title frequently applied to Jesus in the Gospel, signifying his unique relationship 
to the Father. The second Person of the Blessed Trinity is called Son of God in reference to the 
Eternal Father. The revelation of his divine sonship is the principal dramatic development of the 
story of Jesus of Nazareth ( 441-445 1. 

SON OF MAN: The title used by our Lord of himself in the Gospel. This title connotes a 
relationship with the eschatological figure of the “Son of man appearing in clouds and glory” in the 
prophecy of Daniel (M/t 13:26; Dn 7:13) ( 440 : cf. 661 1. 

SOUL: The spiritual principle of human beings. The soul is the subject of human consciousness 
and freedom; soul and body together form one unique human nature. Each human soul is individual 
and immortal, immediately created by God. The soul does not die with the body, from which it is 
separated by death, and with which it will be reunited in the final resurrection ( 363 . 366 : cf. 1703 1. 

SPIRIT : See Holy Spirit . 

STEALING/THEFT: Unjustly taking and keeping the property of another, against the reasonable 
will of the owner ( 2408 1. Stealing is a violation of the seventh commandment of God, “You shall 
not steal.” 


SUICIDE: The willful taking of one’s own life; a grievous sin against the fifth commandment. A 
human person is neither the author nor the supreme arbiter of his life, of which God is sovereign 

















master (2280). 


SUNDAY: The “Lord’s Day,” the principal day of the week for the Eucharistic celebration of the 
Church. Each Sunday Mass commemorates the resurrection of Christ on the first Easter Sunday, 
and is a reminder of the first day of creation for those who have become a “new creation in Christ” 
( 1166 . 2174 . 2180). 

SUPERNATURAL: Surpassing the power of created beings; a result of God’s gracious initiative. 
Our vocation to eternal life is supernatural ( 1998 : cf. 1722 1. 

SUPERSTITION: The attribution of a kind of magical power to certain practices or objects, like 
charms or omens. Reliance on such power, rather than on trust in God, constitutes an offense 
against the honor due to God alone, as required by the first commandment 1 2110 1. 

SYNOD: A meeting of bishops of an ecclesiastical province or patriarchate (or even from the 
whole world, e.g., Synod of Bishops) to discuss the doctrinal and pastoral needs of the church. A 
diocesan synod is an assembly of priests and other members of Christ’s faithful who assist the 
bishop by offering advice about the needs of the diocese and by proposing legislation for him to 
enact 1 887 . 911 1. The words “synod” and “council” are sometimes used interchangeably. 

-T- 

TABERNACLE: The receptacle in the church in which the consecrated Eucharist is reserved for 
Communion for the sick and dying. Reservation of the Eucharist in the tabernacle lends itself to 
private devotional visits and adoration of our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament by the faithful ( 1183 . 
1379 1. 

TEACHING OFFICE: See Magisterium . 

TEMPERANCE: The cardinal moral virtue that moderates the attraction of pleasure and pro¬ 
vides balance in the use of created goods. It ensures the mastery of the will over instinct, and keeps 
natural desires within proper limits 1 1809 1. 

TEMPLE: The house of worship built in Jerusalem by Solomon as God’s dwelling-place, for the 
exercise of the priestly rites of sacrifice in the Jewish religion. After the capture of Jerusalem in 70 
A.D. by the Romans, the second temple was destroyed and never rebuilt. Jesus recognized the 
Temple as God’s dwelling, and a house of prayer; he even identified himself with the Temple by 















presenting himself as God’s definitive dwelling-place. The Holy Spirit makes the Church “the 
temple of the living God” (583, 797; cf. 2580). 


TEMPTATION: An attraction, either from outside oneself or from within, to act contrary to right 
reason and the commandments of God. Jesus himself during his life on earth was tempted, put to 
the test, to manifest both the opposition between himself and the devil and the triumph of his saving 
work over Satan (538). 

TESTAMENT: The name given to the two major parts of the Bible; a synonym for “covenant,” as 
in Old and New Covenants. The Old Testament recounts the history of salvation before the time of 
Christ (46 books), and the New Testament unfolds the saving work of Jesus and the apostolic 
beginnings of the Church (27 books) ( 120—121 . 124 1 See Covenant . 

THEOLOGY: The study of God, based on divine revelation (236, 2033 . 2038 1 

THEOPHANY: A revelation or visible appearance of God, as in the case of Moses at Mount Sinai 
( 2059 1 

TIME: See Eternal Life . 

TRADITION: The living transmission of the message of the Gospel in the Church. The oral 
preaching of the Apostles, and the written message of salvation under the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit (Bible), are conserved and handed on as the deposit of faith through the apostolic succession 
in the Church. Both the living Tradition and the written Scriptures have their common source in the 
revelation of God in Jesus Christ ( 75-82 ). The theological, liturgical, disciplinary, and devotional 
traditions of the local churches both contain and can be distinguished from this apostolic Tradition 
(83). 

TRANSFIGURATION: The mysterious event in which Jesus, seen speaking with Moses and 
Elijah on the mountain, was transformed in appearance—in the sight of Peter, James, and John —as 
a moment of disclosure of his divine glory ( 554 1 

TRANSUBSTANTIATION: The scholastic term used to designate the unique change of the 
Eucharistic bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ. “Transubstantiation” indicates that 
through the consecration of the bread and the wine there occurs the change of the entire substance 
of the bread into the substance of the Body of Christ, and of the entire substance of the wine into 
the Blood of Christ—even though the appearances or “species” of bread and wine remain ( 1376 1 



















TRIDUUM: A liturgical celebration of three days duration, as in the Easter Triduum 1 1168 ). 


TRINITY: The mystery of one God in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The revealed 
truth of the Holy Trinity is at the very root of the Church’s living faith as expressed in the Creed. 
The mystery of the Trinity in itself is inaccessible to the human mind and is the object of faith only 
because it was revealed by Jesus Christ, the divine Son of the eternal Father 1 232 . 237 . 249 . 253- 
256 ). See Person. Divine . 

TYPOLOGY: The discernment of persons, events, or things in the Old Testament which 
prefigured, and thus served as a “type” (or prototype) of, the fulfillment of God’s plan in the person 
of Christ. The typology of the Old Testament which is made clear in the New Testament 
demonstrates the dynamic unity of the divine plan of salvation 1 128 ). 

-U- 


UNITY, CHRISTIAN: See Ecumenism . 


-V- 

VENERATION (OF SAINTS): Showing devotion and respect to Mary, the Apostles, and the 
martyrs, who were viewed as faithful witnesses to faith in Jesus Christ. Eater, veneration was given 
to those who led a life of prayer and self-denial in giving witness to Christ, whose virtues were 
recognized and publicly proclaimed in their canonization as saints 1 828 ). Such veneration is often 
extended to the relics or remains of those recognized as saints; indeed, to many sacred objects and 
images. Veneration must be clearly distinguished from adoration and worship, which are due to 
God alone 1 1154 . 1674 . 2132 ). 

VENIAL SIN: Sin which does not destroy the divine life in the soul, as does mortal sin, though it 
diminishes and wounds it 1 1855 ). Venial sin is the failure to observe necessary moderation, in 
lesser matters of the moral law, or in grave matters acting without full knowledge or complete 
consent 1 1862 ). 

VIATICUM: The Eucharist received by a dying person. It is the spiritual food for one’s “passing 
over” to the Father from this world. With Penance and the Anointing of the Sick, the reception of 
Holy Communion as Viaticum constitute the “last sacraments” of the Christian 1 1524 ). 


VICAR OF CHRIST: A title given to St. Peter, head of the Twelve Apostles, and to his 


















successors, the popes (882); “vicar” means one who stands in for or acts for another. 


VICE: A habit acquired by repeated sin in violation of the proper norms of human morality. The 
vices are often linked with the seven capital sins. Repentance for sin and confession may restore 
grace to a soul, but the removal of the ingrained disposition to sin or vice requires much effort and 
self-denial, until the contrary virtue is acquired (1866). 

VIRGIN BIRTH: The conception of Jesus in the womb of the Virgin Mary solely by the power of 
the Holy Spirit. The Church’s confession of faith in the virgin birth affirms that Jesus was 
conceived by the Holy Spirit without human seed (496). See Virgin Mary . 

VIRGIN MARY: The mother of Jesus, who is honored as “ever-virgin” for her perpetual virginity 
(499). 

VIRTUE: A habitual and firm disposition to do the good. The moral virtues are acquired through 
human effort aided by God’s grace; the theological virtues are gifts of God ( 1803 1 See Cardinal 
Virtues . 

VIRTUES, THEOLOGICAL: Gifts infused by God into the souls of the faithful to make them 
capable of acting as his children and of meriting eternal life. The theological virtues are faith, hope, 
and charity ( 1813 1 

VISION, BEATIFIC: See Beatific Vision . 

VOCATION: The calling or destiny we have in this life and hereafter. God has created the human 
person to love and serve him; the fulfillment of this vocation is eternal happiness (1, 358, 1700 1. 
Christ calls the faithful to the perfection of holiness (825). The vocation of the laity consists in 
seeking the Kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and directing them according to 
God’s will (898). Priestly and religious vocations are dedicated to the service of the Church as the 
universal sacrament of salvation (cf. 873; 931 ). 

VOW: A deliberate and free promise made to God, concerning a possible and better good which 
must be fulfilled by reason of the virtue of religion 1 2102 1. Religious vows, the public profession of 
the evangelical counsels in the Church, have an exemplary value in witnessing to the Kingdom to 
come (cf. 915 1. 


-W- 




















WAY OF THE CROSS: A devotional exercise which follows the “way of the cross” in the 
Savior’s steps, observing stops or “stations” to meditate on the path Jesus took from the Praetorium 
in Jerusalem to Golgotha and the tomb. “By his holy Cross he has redeemed the world” ( 2669 1. 

WISDOM: A spiritual gift which enables one to know the purpose and plan of God; one of the 
seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (1831). Wisdom is also the name of one of the books of the Old 
Testament (120). 

WORD OF GOD: The entire content of Revelation as contained in the Holy Bible and proclaimed 
in the Church. In John’s Gospel, God’s “Word” means his only-begotten Son, who is the fullness 
of God’s Revelation and who took flesh (the Word incarnate) and became man for the sake of our 
salvation (65, 81, 1Q1, 241, 461; cf. 2653 1. 

WORKS OF MERCY: Charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbors in their 
bodily and spiritual needs ( 2447 1. The spiritual works of mercy include instructing, advising, 
consoling, comforting, forgiving, and patiently forbearing. Corporal works of mercy include 
feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, sheltering the homeless, 
and burying the dead 1 2447 1. 

WORLD: Creation, or the earth, or even the universe. “All that is” — often called the “world” in 
Scripture—owes its existence to God’s act of creation; God’s creation is called “good” in the Bible, 
and human beings are said to have been created “in his own image and likeness” (282, 295 1. In the 
New Testament the “world” is sometimes used to indicate the forces of opposition to the work of 
Jesus and of his Holy Spirit. In this sense it signifies the world which Jesus came to redeem from 
sin. The world will reach its goal and perfection when it has been renewed and transformed into 
“the new heaven and the new earth” in the fullness of God’s kingdom 1 1043 1. 

WORSHIP: Adoration and honor given to God, which is the first act of the virtue of religion 
1 2096 1. Public worship is given to God in the Church by the celebration of the Paschal Mystery of 
Christ in the liturgy 1 1067 1. 


-Y- 

YAHWEH (YHWH): The personal name of the God of Israel, revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai, 
meaning “I am who I am” 1 205 1.

The design of the logo is adapted from a Christian tombstone in the catacombs of Domitilla in Rome, which dates from 
the end of the third century A.D. This pastoral image, of pagan origin, was used by Christians to symbolize the rest and 
the happiness that the soul of the departed finds in eternal life. This image also suggests certain characteristic aspects 
of this Catechism: Christ, the Good Shepherd who leads and protects his faithful (the lamb) by his authority (the staff), 
draws them by the melodious symphony of the truth (the panpipes), and makes them lie down in the shade of the tree of 
life, his redeeming Cross which opens paradise.
